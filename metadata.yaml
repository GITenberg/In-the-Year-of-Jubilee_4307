description: "In the Year of Jubilee is the thirteenth novel by English author George\
  \ Gissing. First published in 1894.\nIn the summer of 1893 Gissing returned to London\
  \ after living for two years in Exeter, and took lodgings with his second wife at\
  \ 76 Burton Road, Brixton: \"he realised that in South London there was a new territory\
  \ open to a novelist’s exploitation. From Burton Road he went for long walks through\
  \ nearby Camberwell, soaking up impressions of the way of life he saw emerging there.\"\
  \ This led him to writing In the Year of Jubilee, the story of \"the romantic and\
  \ sexual initiation of a suburban heroine, Nancy Lord.\" Gissing originally called\
  \ his novel “Miss Lord of Camberwell”.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
