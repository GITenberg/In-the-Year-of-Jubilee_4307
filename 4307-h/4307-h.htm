    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning, Arthur Peachey unlocked his front
      door, and quietly went forth. He had not ventured to ask that early
      breakfast should be prepared for him. Enough that he was leaving home for
      a summer holiday&mdash;the first he had allowed himself since his marriage
      three years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a house in De Crespigny Park; unattached, double-fronted, with
      half-sunk basement, and a flight of steps to the stucco pillars at the
      entrance. De Crespigny Park, a thoroughfare connecting Grove Lane,
      Camberwell, with Denmark Hill, presents a double row of similar dwellings;
      its clean breadth, with foliage of trees and shrubs in front gardens,
      makes it pleasant to the eye that finds pleasure in suburban London. In
      point of respectability, it has claims only to be appreciated by the
      ambitious middle-class of Camberwell. Each house seems to remind its
      neighbour, with all the complacence expressible in buff brick, that in
      this locality lodgings are <i>not</i> to let.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour after Peachey&rsquo;s departure, the silence of the house was
      unbroken. Then a bedroom door opened, and a lady in a morning gown of the
      fashionable heliotrope came downstairs. She had acute features; eyes which
      seemed to indicate the concentration of her thoughts upon a difficult
      problem, and cheeks of singular bloom. Her name was Beatrice French; her
      years numbered six and twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the dining-room and drew up the blind. Though the furniture
      was less than a year old, and by no means of the cheapest description,
      slovenly housekeeping had dulled the brightness of every surface. On a
      chair lay a broken toy, one of those elaborate and costly playthings which
      serve no purpose but to stunt a child&rsquo;s imagination. Though the time was
      midsummer, not a flower appeared among the pretentious ornaments. The
      pictures were a strange medley&mdash;autotypes of some artistic value
      hanging side by side with hideous oleographs framed in ponderous gilding.
      Miss. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; then violently rang the bell. When the summons
      had been twice French looked about her with an expression of strong
      disgust, repeated, there appeared a young woman whose features told of
      long and placid slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well? what does this mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cook doesn&rsquo;t feel well, miss; she can&rsquo;t get up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then get breakfast yourself, and look sharp about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice spoke with vehemence; her cheeks showed a circle of richer hue
      around the unchanging rose. The domestic made insolent reply, and there
      began a war of words. At this moment another step sounded on the stairs,
      and as it drew near, a female voice was raised in song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>And a penny in his pocket, la-de-da, la-de-da,&mdash;and a penny in
      his pocket, la-de-da</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A younger girl, this, of much slighter build; with a frisky gait, a jaunty
      pose of the head; pretty, but thin-featured, and shallow-eyed; a long
      neck, no chin to speak of, a low forehead with the hair of washed-out
      flaxen fluffed all over it. Her dress was showy, and in a taste that set
      the teeth on edge. Fanny French, her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up? Another row?&rsquo; she asked, entering the room as the servant went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known a good many fools,&rsquo; said Beatrice, &lsquo;but Ada&rsquo;s the biggest I&rsquo;ve
      come across yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she? Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; Fanny admitted impartially. And with a
      skip she took up her song again. &lsquo;<i>A penny paper collar round his neck,
      la-de-da</i>&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to church this morning?&rsquo; asked her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come for a walk instead. There&rsquo;s something I want to talk to you about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it do afterwards? I&rsquo;ve got an appointment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny laughed and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interrupted by the reappearance of the servant, who brought a tray and
      began to lay the table, they crossed the hall to the drawing-room. In
      half-an-hour&rsquo;s time a sluttish meal was prepared for them, and whilst they
      were satisfying their hunger, the door opened to admit Mrs. Peachey. Ada
      presented herself in a costume which, at any season but high summer, would
      have been inconveniently cool. Beneath a loose thin dressing-gown her
      feet, in felt slippers, showed stockingless, her neck was bare almost to
      the bosom, and the tresses of pale yellow, upon which she especially
      prided herself, lay raggedly pinned together on the top of her flat head.
      She was about twenty-eight years old, but at present looked more than
      thirty. Her features resembled Fanny&rsquo;s, but had a much less amiable
      expression, and betokened, if the thing were possible, an inferior
      intellect. Fresh from the morning basin, her cheeks displayed that
      peculiar colourlessness which results from the habitual use of paints and
      powders; her pale pink lips, thin and sullen, were curiously wrinkled; she
      had eyes of slate colour, with lids so elevated that she always seemed to
      be staring in silly wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve got breakfast, have you?&rsquo; were her first words, in a thin and
      rather nasal voice. &lsquo;You may think yourselves lucky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a cheek of your own,&rsquo; replied Beatrice. &lsquo;Whose place is it to
      see that we get meals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what can any one do with servants like I&rsquo;ve got?&rsquo; retorted the
      married sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault. You should get better; and when you&rsquo;ve got them, you
      should manage them. But that&rsquo;s just what you can&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>you</i>&rsquo;d be a wonderful housekeeper, we know all about that. If
      you&rsquo;re not satisfied, you&rsquo;d better find board and lodging somewhere else,
      as I&rsquo;ve told you often enough. You&rsquo;re not likely to get it as cheap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They squabbled for some minutes, Fanny looking on with ingenuous
      amusement, and putting in a word, now for this side, now for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what am I going to have for breakfast?&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Peachey at
      length, surveying the table. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve taken jolly good care of yourselves,
      it seems to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up, and rang the bell. When a minute&rsquo;s interval brought no
      reply, she rang again. Beatrice thought it probable that the bell might be
      rung without effect, &lsquo;till all was blue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rsquo; answered her sister, and forthwith invaded the
      lower parts of the house. Thence, presently, her voice became audible,
      rising gradually to shrillness; with it there blended the rougher accents
      of the housemaid, now in reckless revolt. Beatrice listened for a minute
      or two in the hall, then passed on into the drawing-room with a
      contemptuous laugh. Fanny, to whom the uproar seemed to bring a renewal of
      appetite, cut herself a slice of bread and butter, and ate it as she stood
      at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dirty cat! beast! swine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress of the house, fairly beaten away by superior force of
      vocabulary, reappeared with these and other exclamations, her face livid,
      her foolish eyes starting from their sockets. Fanny, a sort of Mother
      Cary&rsquo;s chicken, revelled in the row, and screamed her merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before the domestic uproar wholly subsided, but towards eleven
      o&rsquo;clock the sisters found themselves together in the drawing-room. Ada
      sprawled limply on a sofa; Beatrice sat with legs crossed in the most
      comfortable chair; and Fanny twirled about on a music stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only books in the room were a few show-volumes, which belonged to
      Arthur Peachey, and half-a-dozen novels of the meaner kind, wherewith Ada
      sometimes beguiled her infinite leisure. But on tables and chairs lay
      scattered a multitude of papers: illustrated weeklies, journals of
      society, cheap miscellanies, penny novelettes, and the like. At the end of
      the week, when new numbers came in, Ada Peachey passed many hours upon her
      sofa, reading instalments of a dozen serial stories, paragraphs relating
      to fashion, sport, the theatre, answers to correspondents (wherein she
      especially delighted), columns of facetiae, and gossip about notorious
      people. Through a great deal of this matter Beatrice followed her, and
      read much besides in which Ada took no interest; she studied a daily
      newspaper, with special note of law suits, police intelligence, wills,
      bankruptcies, and any concern, great or small, wherein money played a
      part. She understood the nature of investments, and liked to talk about
      stocks and shares with her male acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the daughters of a Camberwell builder, lately deceased; to each
      of them had fallen a patrimony just sufficient for their support in
      elegant leisure. Ada&rsquo;s money, united with a small capital in her husband&rsquo;s
      possession, went to purchase a share in the business of Messrs. Ducker,
      Blunt &amp; Co., manufacturers of disinfectants; Arthur Peachey,
      previously a clerk to the firm, became a junior partner, with the result
      that most of the hard work was thrown upon his shoulders. At their
      marriage, the happy pair first of all established themselves in a modest
      house near Camberwell Road; two years later, growing prosperity brought
      about their removal to De Crespigny Park, where they had now resided for
      some twelve months. Unlike their elder sister, Beatrice and Fanny had
      learnt to support themselves, Beatrice in the postal service, and Fanny,
      sweet blossom! by mingling her fragrance with that of a florist&rsquo;s shop in
      Brixton; but on their father&rsquo;s death both forsook their employment, and
      came to live with Mrs. Peachey. Between them, these two were the owners of
      house-property, which produced L140 a year. They disbursed, together, a
      weekly sum of twenty-four shillings for board and lodging, and spent or
      saved the rest as their impulses dictated.

      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ada brooded over her wrongs; Beatrice glanced over <i>The Referee</i>.
      Fanny, after twirling awhile in maiden meditation, turned to the piano and
      jingled a melody from &lsquo;The Mikado.&rsquo; She broke off suddenly, and, without
      looking round, addressed her companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can give the third seat at the Jubilee to somebody else. I&rsquo;m provided
      for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you going with?&rsquo; asked Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My masher,&rsquo; the girl replied with a giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shop-windows in the Strand, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed her jingling; it was now &lsquo;Queen of my Heart.&rsquo; Beatrice,
      dropping her paper, looked fixedly at the girl&rsquo;s profile, with an eyelid
      droop which signified calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much is he really getting?&rsquo; she inquired all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seventy-five pounds a year. &ldquo;<i>Oh where, oh where, is my leetle dog
      gone?</i>&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he say,&rsquo; asked Mrs. Peachey, &lsquo;that his governor will stump up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke a peculiar tongue, the product of sham education and mock
      refinement grafted upon a stock of robust vulgarity. One and all would
      have been moved to indignant surprise if accused of ignorance or defective
      breeding. Ada had frequented an &lsquo;establishment for young ladies&rsquo; up to the
      close of her seventeenth year; the other two had pursued culture at a
      still more pretentious institute until they were eighteen. All could &lsquo;play
      the piano;&rsquo; all declared&mdash;and believed&mdash;that they &lsquo;knew French.&rsquo; 
      Beatrice had &lsquo;done&rsquo; Political Economy; Fanny had &lsquo;been through&rsquo; Inorganic
      Chemistry and Botany. The truth was, of course, that their minds,
      characters, propensities had remained absolutely proof against such
      educational influence as had been brought to bear upon them. That they
      used a finer accent than their servants, signified only that they had
      grown up amid falsities, and were enabled, by the help of money, to dwell
      above-stairs, instead of with their spiritual kindred below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anticipating Fanny&rsquo;s reply, Beatrice observed, with her air of sagacity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think you&rsquo;re going to get anything out of an old screw like Lord,
      you&rsquo;ll jolly soon find your mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and make a fool of yourself, Fanny,&rsquo; said Mrs. Peachey.
      &lsquo;Why, he can&rsquo;t be more than twenty-one, is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s turned twenty-two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I have who I like for a masher?&rsquo; cried Fanny, reddening a little.
      &lsquo;Who said I was going to marry him? I&rsquo;m in no particular hurry to get
      married. You think everybody&rsquo;s like yourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there was any chance of old Lord turning up his toes,&rsquo; said Beatrice
      thoughtfully. &lsquo;I dare say he&rsquo;ll leave a tidy handful behind him, but then
      he may live another ten years or more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s Nancy,&rsquo; exclaimed Ada. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t she get half the plunder?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May be plenty, even then,&rsquo; said Beatrice, her head aside. &lsquo;The piano
      business isn&rsquo;t a bad line. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he leaves ten or fifteen
      thousand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got anything out of Horace?&rsquo; asked Ada of Fanny. &lsquo;What has he
      told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know much, that&rsquo;s the fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silly! There you are. His father treats him like a boy; if he talked
      about marrying, he&rsquo;d get a cuff on the ear. Oh, I know all about old
      Lord,&rsquo; Ada proceeded. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a regular old tyrant. Why, you&rsquo;ve only to look
      at him. And he thinks no small beer of himself, either, for all he lives
      in that grubby little house; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he thinks us beneath
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at her sisters, inviting their comment on this <i>ludicrous</i>
      state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I quite believe Nancy does,&rsquo; said Fanny, with a point of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a stuck-up thing,&rsquo; declared Mrs. Peachey. &lsquo;And she gets worse as
      she gets older. I shall never invite her again; it&rsquo;s three times she has
      made an excuse&mdash;all lies, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who will <i>she</i> marry?&rsquo; asked Beatrice, in a tone of disinterested
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peachey answered with a sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s going to the Jubilee to pick up a fancy Prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As it happens,&rsquo; objected Fanny, &lsquo;she isn&rsquo;t going to the Jubilee at all.
      At least she says she isn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s above it&mdash;so her brother told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know who <i>wants</i> to marry her,&rsquo; Ada remarked, with a sour smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; came from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Crewe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a significant giggle, Fanny glanced at the more sober of her sisters;
      she, the while, touched her upper lip with the point of her tongue, and
      looked towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he?&rsquo; Fanny asked of the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wants money to float his teetotal drink,&rsquo; said Beatrice. &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he
      been at Arthur about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not that I know,&rsquo; answered the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He tried to get round me, but I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A scream of incredulity from Fanny, and a chuckle from Mrs. Peachey,
      covered the rest of the sentence. Beatrice gazed at them defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, idiots! What&rsquo;s up now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody knows Luckworth Crewe better than I do,&rsquo; Beatrice pursued
      disdainfully, &lsquo;and I think he knows <i>me</i> pretty well. He&rsquo;ll make a
      fool of himself when he marries; I&rsquo;ve told him so, and he as good as said
      I was right. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, I should feel a respect for him. He&rsquo;ll
      have money one of these days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he&rsquo;ll marry Nancy Lord,&rsquo; said Ada tauntingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not just yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada rolled herself from the sofa, and stood yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I shall go and dress. What are you people going to do? You needn&rsquo;t
      expect any dinner. I shall have mine at a restaurant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who have you to meet?&rsquo; asked Fanny, with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister disregarded the question, yawned again, and turned to Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who shall we ask to take Fan&rsquo;s place on Tuesday? Whoever it 15, they&rsquo;ll
      have to pay. Those seats are selling for three guineas, somebody told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation lingered about this point for a few minutes, till Mrs.
      Peachey went upstairs. When the door was open, a child&rsquo;s crying could be
      heard, but it excited no remark. Presently the other two retired, to make
      themselves ready for going out. Fanny was the first to reappear, and,
      whilst waiting for her sister, she tapped out a new music-hall melody on
      the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they left the house, Beatrice remarked that Ada really meant to have
      her dinner at Gatti&rsquo;s or some such place; perhaps they had better indulge
      themselves in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose you give Horace Lord a hint that we&rsquo;ve no dinner at home? He
      might take us, and stand treat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he could get away. The guv&rsquo;nor expects him home to dinner
      on Sundays.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed her contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see! What good is he? Look here, Fan, you just wait a bit, and you&rsquo;ll
      do much better than that. Old Lord would cut up rough as soon as ever such
      a thing was mentioned; I know he would. There&rsquo;s something I have had in my
      mind for a long time. Suppose I could show you a way of making a heap of
      money&mdash;no end of money&mdash;? Shouldn&rsquo;t you like it better,&mdash;to
      live as you pleased, and be independent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener&rsquo;s face confessed curiosity, yet was dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say to going into business with me?&rsquo; pursued Miss French.
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve only to raise a little money on the houses, and in a year or two we
      might be making thousands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Business? What sort of business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose somebody came to you and said: Pay me a sovereign, and I&rsquo;ll make
      you a member of an association that supplies fashionable clothing at about
      half the ordinary price,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you jump at it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I thought it wasn&rsquo;t a swindle,&rsquo; Fanny replied ingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. But you&rsquo;d be made to see it wasn&rsquo;t. And suppose they went on
      to say: Take a ten-pound share, and you shall have a big interest on it,
      as well as your dresses for next to nothing. How would you like that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can it be done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a notion it can, and I think I know two or three people who
      would help to set the thing going. But we must have some capital to show.
      Have you the pluck to join in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And suppose I lose my money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee you the same income you&rsquo;re getting now&mdash;if that will
      satisfy you. I&rsquo;ve been looking round, and making inquiries, and I&rsquo;ve got
      to know a bit about the profits of big dressmakers. We should start in
      Camberwell, or somewhere about there, and fish in all the women who want
      to do the heavy on very little. There are thousands and thousands of them,
      and most of them&rsquo;&mdash;she lowered her voice&mdash;&lsquo;know as much about
      cut and material as they do about stockbroking. Do you twig? People like
      Mrs. Middlemist and Mrs. Murch. They spend, most likely, thirty or forty
      pounds a year on their things, and we could dress them a good deal more
      smartly for half the money. Of course we should make out that a dress we
      sold them for five guineas was worth ten in the shops, and the real cost
      would be two. See? The thing is to persuade them that they&rsquo;re getting an
      article cheap, and at the same time making money out of other people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, and at much greater length, did Miss. French discourse to her
      attentive sister. Forgetful of the time, Fanny found at length that it
      would be impossible to meet Horace Lord as he came out of church; but it
      did not distress her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nancy Lord stood at the front-room window, a hand grasping each side of
      her waist, her look vaguely directed upon the limetree opposite and the
      house which it in part concealed. She was a well-grown girl of three and
      twenty, with the complexion and the mould of form which indicate, whatever
      else, habitual nourishment on good and plenteous food. In her ripe lips
      and softly-rounded cheeks the current of life ran warm. She had hair of a
      fine auburn, and her mode of wearing it, in a plaited diadem, answered the
      purpose of completing a figure which, without being tall, had some
      stateliness and promised more. Her gown, trimmed with a collar of lace,
      left the neck free; the maiden cincture at her waist did no violence to
      natural proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon&mdash;it was Monday&mdash;she could not occupy or amuse
      herself in any of the familiar ways. Perhaps the atmosphere of national
      Jubilee had a disturbing effect upon her,&mdash;in spite of her professed
      disregard for the gathering tumult of popular enthusiasm. She had not left
      home to-day, and the brilliant weather did not tempt her forth. On the
      table lay a new volume from the circulating library,&mdash;something about
      Evolution&mdash;but she had no mind to read it; it would have made her too
      conscious of the insincerity with which she approached such profound
      subjects. For a quarter of an hour and more she had stood at the window,
      regarding a prospect, now as always, utterly wearisome and depressing to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grove Lane is a long acclivity, which starts from Camberwell suburban
      dwellings. The houses vary considerably in size and Green, and, after
      passing a few mean shops, becomes a road of aspect, also in date,&mdash;with
      the result of a certain picturesqueness, enhanced by the growth of fine
      trees on either side. Architectural grace can nowhere be discovered, but
      the contract-builder of today has not yet been permitted to work his will;
      age and irregularity, even though the edifices be but so many
      illustrations of the ungainly, the insipid, and the frankly hideous, have
      a pleasanter effect than that of new streets built to one pattern by the
      mile. There are small cottages overgrown with creepers, relics of
      Camberwell&rsquo;s rusticity; rows of tall and of squat dwellings that lie
      behind grassy plots, railed from the road; larger houses that stand in
      their own gardens, hidden by walls. Narrow passages connect the Lane with
      its more formal neighbour Camberwell Grove; on the other side are ways
      leading towards Denmark Hill, quiet, leafy. From the top of the Lane,
      where Champion Hill enjoys an aristocratic seclusion, is obtainable a
      glimpse of open fields and of a wooded horizon southward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a neighbourhood in decay, a bit of London which does not keep pace
      with the times. And Nancy hated it. She would have preferred to live even
      in a poor and grimy street which neighboured the main track of business
      and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she had spent as much of her life as she remembered, from the end of
      her third year. Mr. Lord never willingly talked of days gone by, but by
      questioning him she had learnt that her birthplace was a vaguely indicated
      part of northern London; there, it seemed, her mother had died, a year or
      so after the birth of her brother Horace. The relatives of whom she knew
      were all on her father&rsquo;s side, and lived scattered about England. When she
      sought information concerning her mother, Mr. Lord became evasive and
      presently silent; she had seen no portrait of the dead parent. Of late
      years this obscure point of the family history had often occupied her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy deemed herself a highly educated young woman,&mdash;&lsquo;cultured&rsquo; was
      the word she would have used. Her studies at a day-school which was
      reputed &lsquo;modern&rsquo; terminated only when she herself chose to withdraw in her
      eighteenth year; and since then she had pursued &lsquo;courses&rsquo; of independent
      reading, had attended lectures, had thought of preparing for examinations&mdash;only
      thought of it. Her father never suggested that she should use these
      acquirements for the earning of money; little as she knew of his affairs,
      it was obviously to be taken for granted that he could ensure her
      life-long independence. Satisfactory, this; but latterly it had become a
      question with her how the independence was to be used, and no intelligible
      aim as yet presented itself to her roving mind. All she knew was, that she
      wished to live, and not merely to vegetate. Now there are so many ways of
      living, and Nancy felt no distinct vocation for any one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was haunted by an uneasy sense of doubtfulness as to her social
      position. Mr. Lord followed the calling of a dealer in pianos; a
      respectable business, to be sure, but, it appeared, not lucrative enough
      to put her above caring how his money was made. She knew that one&rsquo;s father
      may be anything whatever, yet suffer no social disability, provided he
      reap profit enough from the pursuit. But Stephen Lord, whilst resorting
      daily to his warehouse in Camberwell Road&mdash;not a locality that one
      would care to talk about in &lsquo;cultured&rsquo; circles&mdash;continued, after
      twenty years, to occupy this small and ugly dwelling in Grove Lane.
      Possibly, owing to an imperfect education, he failed to appreciate his
      daughter&rsquo;s needs, and saw no reason why she should not be happy in the old
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, perhaps he cared very little about her. Undoubtedly his
      favourite was Horace, and in Horace he had suffered a disappointment. The
      boy, in spite of good schooling, had proved unequal to his father&rsquo;s hope
      that he would choose some professional career, by preference the law; he
      idled away his schooldays, failed at examinations, and ultimately had to
      be sent into &lsquo;business.&rsquo; Mr Lord obtained a place for him in a large
      shipping agency; but it still seemed doubtful whether he would make any
      progress there, notwithstanding the advantage of his start; at
      two-and-twenty he was remunerated with a mere thirty shillings a week, a
      nominal salary,&rsquo; his employers called it. Nancy often felt angry with her
      brother for his lack of energy and ambition; he might so easily, she
      thought, have helped to establish, by his professional dignity, her own
      social status at the level she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came into view a familiar figure, crossing from the other side of
      the way. Nancy started, waved her hand, and went to open the door. Her
      look had wholly altered; she was bright, mirthful, overflowing with
      affectionate welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      This friend of hers, Jessica Morgan by name, had few personal attractions.
      She looked overwrought and low-spirited; a very plain and slightly-made
      summer gown exhibited her meagre frame with undue frankness; her face
      might have been pretty if health had filled and coloured the flesh, but as
      it was she looked a ghost of girlhood, a dolorous image of frustrate sex.
      In her cotton-gloved hand she carried several volumes and notebooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re in,&rsquo; was her first utterance, between pants after
      hasty walking and the jerks of a nervous little laugh. &lsquo;I want to ask you
      something about Geometrical Progression. You remember that formula&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I remember what I never knew?&rsquo; exclaimed Nancy. &lsquo;I always hated
      those formulas; I couldn&rsquo;t learn them to save my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nonsense! You were much better at mathematics than I was. Do
      just look at what I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw her books down upon a chair, and opened some pages of scrawled
      manuscript, talking hurriedly in a thin falsetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her family, a large one, had fallen of late years from a position of
      moderate comfort into sheer struggle for subsistence. Jessica, armed with
      certificates of examinational prowess, got work as a visiting governess.
      At the same time, she nourished ambitions, discernible perhaps in the
      singular light of her deep-set eyes and a something of hysteric
      determination about her lips. Her aim, at present, was to become a
      graduate of London University; she was toiling in her leisure hours&mdash;the
      hours of exhaustion, that is to say&mdash;to prepare herself for
      matriculation, which she hoped to achieve in the coming winter. Of her
      intimate acquaintances only one could lay claim to intellectual
      superiority, and even she, Nancy Lord to wit, shrank from the ordeals of
      Burlington House. To become B.A., to have her name in the newspapers, to
      be regarded as one of the clever, the uncommon women&mdash;for this
      Jessica was willing to labour early and late, regardless of failing
      health, regardless even of ruined complexion and hair that grew thin
      beneath the comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked only of the &lsquo;exam,&rsquo; of her chances in this or that &lsquo;paper,&rsquo; of
      the likelihood that this or the other question would be &lsquo;set.&rsquo; Her brain
      was becoming a mere receptacle for dates and definitions, vocabularies and
      rules syntactic, for thrice-boiled essence of history, ragged scraps of
      science, quotations at fifth hand, and all the heterogeneous rubbish of a
      &lsquo;crammer&rsquo;s&rsquo; shop. When away from her books, she carried scraps of paper,
      with jottings to be committed to memory. Beside her plate at meals lay
      formulae and tabulations. She went to bed with a manual and got up with a
      compendium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, whose pursuit of &lsquo;culture&rsquo; followed a less exhausting track,
      regarded the girl with a little envy and some compassion. Esteeming
      herself in every respect Jessica&rsquo;s superior, she could not help a slight
      condescension in the tone she used to her; yet their friendship had much
      sincerity on both sides, and each was the other&rsquo;s only confidante. As soon
      as the mathematical difficulty could be set aside, Nancy began to speak of
      her private troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Prophet was here last night,&rsquo; she said, with a girlish grimace. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      beginning again. I can see it coming. I shall have to snub him awfully
      next time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what a worry he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s something worse. I suspected that the Pasha knew of it;
      now I feel sure he&rsquo;s encouraging him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this oriental style Nancy signified her father. The Prophet was her
      father&rsquo;s partner in business, Mr. Samuel Bennett Barmby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel sure now that they talked it over when the Prophet was taken into
      partnership. I was thrown in as a &ldquo;consideration.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how could your father possibly think&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say what he <i>does</i> think about me. I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
      have to have a talk with him. If so, it will be a long talk, and a very
      serious talk. But he isn&rsquo;t well just now, and I must put it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A touch of gout, he says. Two days last week he didn&rsquo;t go to business,
      and his temper was <i>that &lsquo;orrible</i>!&rsquo; Nancy had a habit of facetiously
      quoting vulgarities; this from an acquaintance of theirs who often
      supplied them with mirth. &lsquo;I suppose the gout does make one bad-tempered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been coming often?&mdash;Mr. Barmby, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well. I think I must turn matchmaker, and get him married to some
      one. It oughtn&rsquo;t to be difficult. The Prophet &ldquo;has points.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say some people would think him handsome,&rsquo; assented Miss Morgan,
      nibbling a finger which showed an ink-stain, and laughing shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his powers of conversation!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you know any one that would
      do for him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They jested on this theme until Nancy chose to become serious again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any lessons to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Thank goodness every one is going to see the procession, or the
      decorations, or the illuminations, and all the rest of the nonsense,&rsquo; 
      Jessica replied. &lsquo;I shall have a good long day of work; except that I&rsquo;ve
      promised to go in the afternoon, and have tea with the little girls at
      Champion Hill. I wish you&rsquo;d come too; they&rsquo;d be delighted to see you, and
      there&rsquo;ll be nobody except the governess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked up in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure? Won&rsquo;t the dowager be at home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t left her room for three weeks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged a look of some special significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I suppose,&rsquo; said Nancy, with a peculiar smile, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why Mr
      Tarrant has been calling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he? How do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they looked at each other, and Nancy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have happened to meet him twice, the last few days.&rsquo; She spoke in an
      off-hand way. &lsquo;The first time, it was just at the top of the lane; he was
      coming away. The second time, I was walking along Champion Hill, and he
      came up behind me, going to the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he talk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy gave a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, both times. But he didn&rsquo;t tell me that the dowager was worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;High and mighty?&rsquo; asked Jessica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite so majestic as usual, I thought. I didn&rsquo;t feel quite so much of
      a shrimp before him. And decidedly he was in better spirits. Perhaps the
      dowager&rsquo;s death would be important to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely. Will you come to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss. Lord hesitated&mdash;then, with a sudden frankness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m afraid he might be there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so, not on Jubilee Day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that&rsquo;s the very reason. He may come to be out of the uproar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant he was more likely to be out of town altogether.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, still leaning over the table, propped her chin on her hands, and
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where does he go, I wonder?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, all sorts of places, no doubt. Men of that kind are always
      travelling. I suppose he goes shooting and fishing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s laugh made an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, he doesn&rsquo;t! He told me once that he didn&rsquo;t care for that sort of
      thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, you know much more about him than I do,&rsquo; said Miss Morgan, with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve often meant to ask you&mdash;have they anything to do with Tarrant&rsquo;s
      black-lead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica declared that she had never heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never heard of it? nonsense! A few years ago it used to be posted up
      everywhere, and I see it sometimes even now, but other kinds seem to have
      driven it out of the market. Now that&rsquo;s just like you! Pray, did you ever
      hear of Pears&rsquo; Soap?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? Oh, there&rsquo;s hope of you. You&rsquo;ll be a woman of the world some
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tease, Nancy. And what would it matter if he <i>was</i> there
      to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know. But I shouldn&rsquo;t particularly like his lordship to
      imagine that I went in the hope of paying my respects to him, and having
      the reward of a gracious smile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One can&rsquo;t always be thinking about what other people think,&rsquo; said Jessica
      impatiently. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re too sensitive. Any one else in your position would
      have lots of such friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my position! What <i>is</i> my position?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Culture is everything now-a-days,&rsquo; observed Miss. Morgan, with the air of
      one who feels herself abundantly possessed of that qualification.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nancy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may depend upon it, Mr. Tarrant doesn&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He calls himself a democrat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And talks like one: doesn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s only his way, I think. He doesn&rsquo;t really mean to be haughty,
      and&mdash;and so on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I knew if he had any connection with Tarrant&rsquo;s blacklead,&rsquo; said
      Miss. Lord mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not ask him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed merrily, Jessica&rsquo;s thin note contrasting with the mellow
      timbre of her friend&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would never dare to!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t? Then I will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be dreadfully rude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind being thought rude,&rsquo; replied Nancy, with a movement of the
      head, &lsquo;if it teaches people that I consider myself as good as they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, will you come to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-es; if you&rsquo;ll go somewhere else with me in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To walk about the streets after dark, and see the crowds and the
      illuminations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy uttered this with a sly mirthfulness. Her friend was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do. I want to go for the fun of the thing. I should feel ashamed of
      myself if I ran to stare at Royalties, but it&rsquo;s a different thing at
      night. It&rsquo;ll be wonderful, all the traffic stopped, and the streets
      crammed with people, and blazing with lights. Won&rsquo;t you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the time, the time! I can&rsquo;t afford it. I&rsquo;m getting on so wretchedly
      with my Greek and my chemistry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve time enough,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;And, you know, after all it&rsquo;s a
      historical event. In the year 3000 it will be &lsquo;set&rsquo; in an examination
      paper, and poor wretches will get plucked because they don&rsquo;t know the
      date.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite a new aspect of the matter to Jessica Morgan. She pondered
      it, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose it will. But we should have to be out so late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not, for once? It needn&rsquo;t be later than half-past eleven.&rsquo; Nancy
      broke off and gesticulated. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just why I want to go! I should like
      to walk about all night, as lots of people will. The public-houses are
      going to be kept open till two o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want to go into public-houses?&rsquo; asked Jessica, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? I should like to. It&rsquo;s horrible to be tied up as we are; we&rsquo;re
      not children. Why can&rsquo;t we go about as men do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t your father make any objection?&rsquo; asked Jessica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall take Horace with us. Your people wouldn&rsquo;t interfere, would
      they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not. Father is away in Yorkshire, and will be till the end of the
      week. Poor mother has her rheumatism. The house is so dreadfully damp. We
      ought never to have taken it. The difference of rent will all go in
      doctors&rsquo; bills.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think mother would mind; but I must be back
      before twelve, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;of course,&rdquo;&rsquo; Nancy returned impatiently, &lsquo;but we could
      manage that. I&rsquo;ll speak to the Pasha to-night, and either come, or let you
      have a note, to-morrow morning. If there&rsquo;s any objection, I&rsquo;m not sure
      that I shan&rsquo;t make it the opportunity for setting up my standard of
      revolt. But I don&rsquo;t like to do that whilst the Pasha is out of sorts&mdash;it
      might make him worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could reason with him quietly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reason with the Pasha&mdash;How innocent you are, Jess! How unworldly! It
      always refreshes me to hear you talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      Only twelve months ago Stephen Lord had renewed the lease of his house for
      a period of seven years. Nancy, had she been aware of this transaction,
      would assuredly have found courage to enter a protest, but Mr. Lord
      consulted neither son nor daughter on any point of business; but for this
      habit of acting silently, he would have seemed to his children a still
      more arbitrary ruler than they actually thought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwelling consisted of but eight rooms, one of which, situated at the
      rear of the entrance passage, served Mr. Lord as sitting-room and
      bed-chamber; it overlooked a small garden, and afforded a side glimpse of
      the kitchen with its outer appurtenances. In the front room the family
      took meals. Of the chambers in the storey above, one was Nancy&rsquo;s, one her
      brother&rsquo;s; the third had, until six years ago, been known as
      &lsquo;Grandmother&rsquo;s room,&rsquo; and here its occupant, Stephen Lord&rsquo;s mother, died
      at the age of seventy-eight. Wife of a Norfolk farmer, and mother of nine
      children, she was one of the old-world women whose thoughts found abundant
      occupation in the cares and pleasures of home. Hardship she had never
      known, nor yet luxury; the old religion, the old views of sex and of
      society, endured with her to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her death the room was converted into a parlour, used almost
      exclusively by the young people. At the top of the house slept two
      servants, each in her own well-furnished retreat; one of them was a girl,
      the other a woman of about forty, named Mary Woodruff. Mary had been in
      the house for twenty years; she enjoyed her master&rsquo;s confidence, and,
      since old Mrs. Lord&rsquo;s death, exercised practical control in the humbler
      domestic affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one exception, all parts of the abode presented much the same
      appearance as when Stephen Lord first established himself antiquated, and
      in primitive taste. Nancy&rsquo;s bedroom alone here. The furniture was old,
      solid, homely; the ornaments were displayed the influence of modern ideas.
      On her twentieth birthday, the girl received permission to dress
      henceforth as she chose (a strict sumptuary law having previously been in
      force), and at the same time was allowed to refurnish her chamber. Nancy
      pleaded for modern reforms throughout the house, but in vain; even the
      drawing-room kept its uninviting aspect, not very different, save for the
      removal of the bed, from that it had presented when the ancient lady slept
      here. In her own little domain, Miss. Lord made a clean sweep of rude
      appointments, and at small expense surrounded herself with pretty things.
      The woodwork and the furniture were in white enamel; the paper had a
      pattern of wild-rose. A choice chintz, rose-leaf and flower on a white
      ground, served for curtains and for bed-hangings. Her carpet was of green
      felt, matching in shade the foliage of the chintz. On suspended shelves
      stood the books which she desired to have near her, and round about the
      walls hung prints, photographs, chromolithographs, selected in an honest
      spirit of admiration, which on the whole did no discredit to Nancy&rsquo;s
      sensibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the best of Nancy&rsquo;s belief, her father had never seen this room. On its
      completion she invited him to inspect it, but Mr. Lord coldly declined,
      saying that he knew nothing, and cared nothing, about upholstery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His return to-day was earlier than usual. Shortly after five o&rsquo;clock Nancy
      heard the familiar heavy step in the passage, and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have a cup of tea, father?&rsquo; she asked, standing by the door of
      the back room, which was ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s ready,&rsquo; replied a deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the dining-room, and rang the bell. In a few minutes Mary
      Woodruff appeared, bringing tea and biscuits. She was a neat, quiet,
      plain-featured woman, of strong physique, and with set lips, which rarely
      parted save for necessary speech. Her eyes had a singular expression of
      inquietude, of sadness. A smile seldom appeared on her face, but, when it
      did, the effect was unlooked for: it touched the somewhat harsh lineaments
      with a gentleness so pleasing that she became almost comely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set down the tray, she went to Mr. Lord&rsquo;s door, gave a soft tap,
      and withdrew into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, seated at the table, turned to greet her father. In early life,
      Stephen Lord must have been handsome; his face was now rugged, of
      unhealthy tone, and creased with lines betokening a moody habit. He looked
      much older than his years, which were fifty-seven. Dressed with excessive
      carelessness, he had the appearance rather of one at odds with fortune
      than of a substantial man of business. His short beard was raggedly
      trimmed; his grizzled hair began to show the scalp. Judging from the
      contour of his visage, one might have credited him with a forcible and
      commanding character; his voice favoured that impression; but the
      countenance had a despondent cast, the eyes seemed to shun observation,
      the lips suggested a sullen pride, indicative of some defect or vice of
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in the look which he cast upon her, Nancy detected a sign of more
      amiability than she had found in him of late. She addressed him with
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Early to-day, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monosyllable sounded gruff, but again Nancy felt satisfaction. Mr.
      Lord, who disliked to seat himself unless he were going to keep his
      position for some time, took the offered beverage from his daughter&rsquo;s
      hand, and stood with it before the fireplace, casting glances about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How have you felt, father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing to complain of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His pronunciation fell short of refinement, but was not vulgar. Something
      of country accent could still be detected in it. He talked like a man who
      could strike a softer note if he cared to, but despises the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you will have a rest to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so. If your grandmother had lived,&rsquo; he added thoughtfully, &lsquo;she
      would have been eighty-four this week on Thursday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The 23rd of June. Yes, I remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lord swallowed his tea at two draughts, and put down the cup.
      Seemingly refreshed, he looked about him with a half smile, and said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of punishing a scoundrel to-day. That&rsquo;s worth more
      than the Jubilee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy waited for an explanation, but it was not vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A scoundrel?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father nodded&mdash;the nod which signified his pleasure that the
      subject should not be pursued. Nancy could only infer that he spoke of
      some incident in the course of business, as indeed was the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no particular aptitude for trade, and that by which he lived (he
      had entered upon it thirty years ago rather by accident than choice) was
      thoroughly distasteful to him. As a dealer in pianofortes, he came into
      contact with a class of people who inspired him with a savage contempt,
      and of late years his business had suffered considerably from the
      competition of tradesmen who knew nothing of such conflicts between
      sentiment and interest. A majority of his customers obtained their pianos
      on the &lsquo;hire-purchase system,&rsquo; and oftener than not, they were persons of
      very small or very precarious income, who, rabid in the pursuit of
      gentility, signed agreements they had little chance of fulfilling; when in
      pecuniary straits, they either raised money upon the instruments, or
      allowed them to fall into the hands of distraining creditors. Inquiry into
      the circumstances of a would-be customer sometimes had ludicrous results;
      a newly-married couple, for instance, would be found tenanting two
      top-floor rooms, the furnishing whereof seemed to them incomplete without
      the piano of which their friends and relatives boasted. Not a few
      professional swindlers came to the office; confederate rogues, vouching
      for each other&rsquo;s respectability, got possession of pianos merely to pawn
      or sell them, having paid no more than the first month&rsquo;s charge. It was Mr
      Lord&rsquo;s experience that year by year the recklessness of the vulgar became
      more glaring, and deliberate fraud more artful. To-day he had successfully
      prosecuted a man who seemed to have lived for some time on the
      hire-purchase system, and it made him unusually cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think of going to see the Queen to-morrow?&rsquo; said his daughter,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have I to do with the Queen? Do you wish to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to see Her Majesty. I care as little about her as you do. But I
      thought of having a walk in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy phrased it thus with intention. She wished to intimate that, at her
      age, it could hardly be necessary to ask permission. But her father looked
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the evening? Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, about the main streets&mdash;to see the people and the
      illuminations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was not quite firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll be such a swarm of blackguards as never
      was known. How can you go into such a crowd? It&rsquo;s astonishing that you
      should think of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The blackguards will be outnumbered by the decent people, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You suppose that&rsquo;s possible?&rsquo; he returned gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I think so,&rsquo; Nancy laughed. &lsquo;At all events, there&rsquo;ll be a great
      majority of people who pretend to be decent. I have asked Jessica Morgan
      to go with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What right had you to ask her, without first finding out whether you
      could go or not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was spoken rather gravely than severely. Mr. Lord never looked fixedly
      at his daughter, and even a glance at her face was unusual; but at this
      juncture he met her eyes for an instant. The nervous motion with which he
      immediately turned aside had been marked by Nancy on previous occasions,
      and she had understood it as a sign of his lack of affection for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am twenty-three years old, father,&rsquo; she replied, without
      aggressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would be something of an answer if you were a man,&rsquo; observed the
      father, his eyes cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I am a woman, you despise me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was startled at this unfamiliar mode of address. He moved
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I despised you, Nancy, I shouldn&rsquo;t care very much what you did. I
      suppose you must do as you like, but you won&rsquo;t go with my permission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, then the girl said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant to ask Horace to go with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace&mdash;pooh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a silence. Mr. Lord laid down his cup, moved a few steps away, and
      turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think this kind of thing was in your way,&rsquo; he said gruffly. &lsquo;I
      thought you were above it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy defended herself as she had done to Jessica, but without the
      playfulness. In listening, her father seemed to weigh the merits of the
      case conscientiously with wrinkled brows. At length he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace is no good. But if Samuel Barmby will go with you, I make no
      objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement of annoyance was Nancy&rsquo;s first reply. She drummed with her
      fingers on the table, looking fixedly before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly can&rsquo;t ask Mr. Barmby to come with us,&rsquo; she said, with an
      effort at self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll speak about it myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, and again it chanced that their eyes met. Nancy, on the point
      of speaking, checked herself. A full minute passed, and Stephen stood
      waiting patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you insist upon it,&rsquo; said Nancy, rising from her chair, &lsquo;we will take
      Mr. Barmby with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without comment, Mr. Lord left the room, and his own door closed rather
      loudly behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long afterwards Nancy heard a new foot in the passage, and her brother
      made his appearance. Horace had good looks, but his face showed already
      some of the unpleasant characteristics which time had developed on that of
      Stephen Lord, and from which the daughter was entirely free; one judged
      him slow of intellect and weakly self-willed. His hair was of pale
      chestnut, the silky pencillings of his moustache considerably darker. His
      cheek, delicately pink and easily changing to a warmer hue, his
      bright-coloured lips, and the limpid glistening of his eyes, showed him of
      frail constitution; he was very slim, and narrow across the shoulders. The
      fashion of his attire tended to a dandiacal extreme,&mdash;modish silk
      hat, lavender necktie, white waistcoat, gaiters over his patent-leather
      shoes, gloves crushed together in one hand, and in the other a bamboo
      cane. For the last year or two he had been progressing in this direction,
      despite his father&rsquo;s scornful remarks and his sister&rsquo;s good-natured
      mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father in yet?&rsquo; he asked at the door of the dining-room, in subdued
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy nodded, and the young man withdrew to lay aside his outdoor
      equipments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of temper?&rsquo; was his question when he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty good&mdash;until I spoilt it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace exhibited a pettish annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What on earth did you do that for? I want to have a talk with him
      to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind; I&rsquo;ll tell you after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both kept their voices low, as if afraid of being overheard in the next
      room. Horace began to nibble at a biscuit; the hour of his return made it
      unnecessary for him, as a rule, to take anything before dinner, but at
      present he seemed in a nervous condition, and acted mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come out into the garden, will you?&rsquo; he said, after receiving a brief
      explanation of what had passed between Nancy and her father. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      something to tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister carelessly assented, and with heads uncovered they went through
      the house into the open air. The garden was but a strip of ground, bounded
      by walls of four feet high; in the midst stood a laburnum, now heavy with
      golden bloom, and at the end grew a holly-bush, flanked with laurels; a
      border flower-bed displayed Stephen Lord&rsquo;s taste and industry. Nancy
      seated herself on a rustic bench in the shadow of the laburnum, and Horace
      stood before her, one of the branches in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promised Fanny to take her to-morrow night,&rsquo; he began awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we&rsquo;re going together in the morning, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know now. I didn&rsquo;t before,&rsquo; Nancy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we can make a party in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked up at the ugly house-backs, and hesitated before proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I wanted to talk about,&rsquo; he said at length. &lsquo;A very queer
      thing has happened, a thing I can&rsquo;t make out at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener looked her curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promised to say nothing about it, but there&rsquo;s no harm in telling you,
      you know. You remember I was away last Saturday afternoon? Well, just when
      it was time to leave the office, that day, the porter came to say that a
      lady wished to see me&mdash;a lady in a carriage outside. Of course I
      couldn&rsquo;t make it out at all, but I went down as quickly as possible, and
      saw the carriage waiting there,&mdash;a brougham,&mdash;and marched up to
      the door. Inside there was a lady&mdash;a great swell, smiling at me as if
      we were friends. I took off my hat, and said that I was Mr. Lord. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I see you are;&rdquo; and she asked if I could spare her an hour or
      two, as she wished to speak to me of something important. Well, of course
      I could only say that I had nothing particular to do,&mdash;that I was
      just going home. &ldquo;Then will you do me the pleasure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to come
      and have lunch with me? I live in Weymouth Street, Portland Place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused to watch the effect of his narrative, especially of
      the last words. Nancy returned his gaze with frank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of lady was it?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a great swell. Somebody in the best society&mdash;you could see that
      at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how old?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly; about forty, I should think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&mdash;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One couldn&rsquo;t refuse, you know; I was only too glad to go to a house in
      the West End. She opened the carriage-door from the inside, and I got in,
      and off we drove. I felt awkward, of course, but after all I was decently
      dressed, and I suppose I can behave like a gentleman, and&mdash;well, she
      sat looking at me and smiling, and I could only smile back. Then she said
      she must apologise for behaving so strangely, but I was very young, and
      she was an old woman,&mdash;one couldn&rsquo;t call her that, though,&mdash;and
      she had taken this way of renewing her acquaintance with me. Renewing? But
      I didn&rsquo;t remember to have ever met her before, I said. &ldquo;Oh, yes, we have
      met before, but you were a little child, a baby in fact, and there&rsquo;s no
      wonder you don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo; And then she said, &ldquo;I knew your mother very
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy leaned forward, her lips apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queer, wasn&rsquo;t it? Then she went on to say that her name was Mrs. Damerel;
      had I ever heard it? No, I couldn&rsquo;t remember the name at all. She was a
      widow, she said, and had lived mostly abroad for a great many years; now
      she was come back to settle in England. She hadn&rsquo;t a house of her own yet,
      but lived at a boarding-house; she didn&rsquo;t know whether to take a house in
      London, or somewhere just out in the country. Then she began to ask about
      father, and about you; and it seemed to amuse her when I looked puzzled.
      She&rsquo;s a jolly sort of person, always laughing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she say anything more about our mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about that presently. We got to the house, and went in, and
      she took me upstairs to her own private sitting-room, where the table was
      laid for two. She said that she usually had her meals with the other
      people, but it would be better for us to be alone, so that we could talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did she know where to find you?&rsquo; Nancy inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I wondered about that, but I didn&rsquo;t like to ask. Well, she went
      away for a few minutes, and then we had lunch. Everything was A-1 of
      course; first-rate wines to choose from, and a rattling good cigar
      afterwards&mdash;for me, I mean. She brought out a box; said they were her
      husband&rsquo;s, and had a laugh about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long has she been a widow?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t wear colours, I noticed; perhaps it was a
      fashionable sort of mourning. We talked about all sorts of things; I soon
      made myself quite at home. And at last she began to explain. She was a
      friend of mother&rsquo;s, years and years ago, and father was the cause of their
      parting, a quarrel about something, she didn&rsquo;t say exactly what. And it
      had suddenly struck her that she would like to know how we were getting
      on. Then she asked me to promise that I would tell no one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knew about mother&rsquo;s death, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, she knew about that. It happened not very long after the affair
      that parted them. She asked a good many questions about you. And she
      wanted to know how father had got on in his business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I told her I really didn&rsquo;t know much about it, and she laughed at
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long did you stay there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till about four. But there&rsquo;s something else. Before I went away she gave
      me an invitation for next Saturday. She wants me to meet her at Portland
      Road Station, and go out to Richmond, and have dinner there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very awkward. I want to go somewhere else on Saturday, with
      Fanny. But I didn&rsquo;t see how to refuse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy wore a look of grave reflection, and kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, you know,&rsquo; pursued her brother, &lsquo;to have a friend
      of that sort. There&rsquo;s no knowing what use she might be, especially just
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone caused Nancy to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why just now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after I&rsquo;ve had a talk with father to-night,&rsquo; Horace
      replied, setting his countenance to a show of energetic resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I guess what you&rsquo;re going to talk about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re surely not so silly as to tell father about all that nonsense?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense?&rsquo; exclaimed the other indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, with Fanny French.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s anything but nonsense,&rsquo; Horace replied, raising his
      brows, and gazing straight before him, with expanded nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Let me know the result. It&rsquo;s time to go in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat alone for a minute or two, his legs at full length, his feet
      crossed, and the upper part of his body bent forward. He smiled to
      himself, a smile of singular fatuity, and began to hum a popular tune.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they assembled at table, Mr. Lord had recovered his moderate
      cheerfulness. Essentially, he was anything but ill-tempered; Horace and
      Nancy were far from regarding him with that resentful bitterness which is
      produced in the victims of a really harsh parent. Ten years ago, as they
      well remembered, anger was a rare thing in his behaviour to them, and
      kindness the rule. Affectionate he had never shown himself; reserve and
      austerity had always distinguished him. Even now-a-days, it was generally
      safe to anticipate mildness from him at the evening meal. In the matter of
      eating and drinking his prudence notably contradicted his precepts. He
      loved strong meats, dishes highly flavoured, and partook of them without
      moderation. At table his beverage was ale; for wine&mdash;unless it were
      very sweet port&mdash;he cared little; but in the privacy of his own room,
      whilst smoking numberless pipes of rank tobacco, he indulged freely in
      spirits. The habit was unknown to his children, but for some years he had
      seldom gone to bed in a condition that merited the name of sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the repast was nearly over, Mr. Lord glanced at his son and said
      unconcernedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard that Nancy wants to mix with the rag-tag and bobtail
      to-morrow night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall take care of her,&rsquo; Horace replied, starting from his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you rather a come-down for an educated young lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;ll be lots of them about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will there? Then I can&rsquo;t see much difference between them and the servant
      girls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy put in a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shows you don&rsquo;t in the least understand me, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t argue about it. But bear in mind, Horace, that you bring your
      sister back not later than half-past eleven. You are to be here by
      half-past eleven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather early,&rsquo; replied the young man, though in a submissive tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the hour I appoint. Samuel Barmby will be with you, and he will know
      the arrangement; but I tell you now, so that there may be no
      misunderstanding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy sat in a very upright position, displeasure plain upon her
      countenance. But she made no remark. Horace, who had his reasons for
      desiring to preserve a genial tone, affected acquiescence. Presently he
      and his sister went upstairs to the drawing-room, where they sat down at a
      distance apart&mdash;Nancy by the window, gazing at the warm clouds above
      the roofs opposite, the young man in a corner which the dusk already
      shadowed. Some time passed before either spoke, and it was Horace&rsquo;s voice
      which first made itself heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time we began to behave firmly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It depends what you mean by firmness,&rsquo; she answered in an absent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re old enough to judge for ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, no doubt. But I&rsquo;m not so sure about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, all right. Then we won&rsquo;t talk about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another quarter of an hour went by. The room was in twilight. There came a
      knock at the door, and Mary Woodruff, a wax-taper in her hand, entered to
      light the gas. Having drawn the blind, and given a glance round to see
      that everything was in order, she addressed Nancy, her tone perfectly
      respectful, though she used no formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martha has been asking me whether she can go out to-morrow night for an
      hour or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t wish to go yourself?&rsquo; Miss. Lord returned, her voice
      significant of life-long familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary showed one of her infrequent smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She may go immediately after dinner, and be away till half-past ten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bent her head, and withdrew. As soon as she was gone, Horace
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are! What did father say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to have a word with him,&rsquo; continued the young man,
      sauntering towards the door with his hands in his pockets. He looked
      exceedingly nervous. &lsquo;When I come back, I may have something to tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; remarked his sister in a dry tone, and seated herself under
      the chandelier with a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace slowly descended the stairs. At the foot he stood for a moment,
      then moved towards his father&rsquo;s door. Another hesitancy, though briefer,
      and he knocked for admission, which was at once granted. Mr. Lord sat in
      his round-backed chair, smoking a pipe, on his knees an evening paper. He
      looked at Horace from under his eyebrows, but with good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming to report progress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, father,&mdash;and to talk over things in general.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The slim youth&mdash;he could hardly be deemed more than a lad tried to
      assume an easy position, with his elbow on the corner of the mantelpiece;
      but his feet shuffled, and his eyes strayed vacantly. It cost him an
      effort to begin his customary account of how things were going with him at
      the shipping-office. In truth, there was nothing particular to report;
      there never was anything particular; but Horace always endeavoured to show
      that he had made headway, and to-night he spoke with a very pronounced
      optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my boy,&rsquo; said his father. &lsquo;If you are satisfied, I shall try
      to be the same. Have you your pipe with you?&mdash;At your age I hadn&rsquo;t
      begun to smoke, and I should advise you to be moderate; but we&rsquo;ll have a
      whiff together, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and fetch it,&rsquo; Horace replied impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back with a rather expensive meerschaum, recently purchased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo! luxuries!&rsquo; exclaimed his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It kept catching my eye in a window,&mdash;and at last I couldn&rsquo;t resist.
      Tobacco&rsquo;s quite a different thing out of a pipe like this, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, seeing them thus together, could have doubted of the affectionate
      feeling which Stephen Lord entertained for his son. It appeared in his
      frequent glances, in the relaxation of his features, in a certain
      abandonment of his whole frame, as though he had only just begun to enjoy
      the evening&rsquo;s repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve something rather important to speak about, father,&rsquo; Horace began,
      when he had puffed for a few minutes in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh? What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember telling me, when I was one and twenty, that you wished me to
      work my way up, and win an income of my own, but that I could look to you
      for help, if ever there was need of it&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Stephen remembered. He had frequently called it to mind, and wondered
      whether it was wisely said, the youth&rsquo;s character considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of that?&rsquo; he returned, still genially. &lsquo;Do you think of starting a
      new line of ocean steamships?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, not just yet,&rsquo; Horace answered, with an uncertain laugh. &lsquo;I have
      something more moderate in view. I may start a competition with the P. and
      O. presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hear about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it will surprise you a little. The fact is, I&mdash;I am
      thinking of getting married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The father did not move, but smoke ceased to issue from his lips, and his
      eyes, fixed upon Horace, widened a little in puzzled amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thinking of it, are you?&rsquo; he said, in an undertone, as one speaks of some
      trifle. &lsquo;No harm in thinking. Too many people do it without thinking at
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not one of that kind,&rsquo; said Horace, with an air of maturity which was
      meant to rebuke his father&rsquo;s jest. &lsquo;I know what I&rsquo;m about. I&rsquo;ve thought it
      over thoroughly. You don&rsquo;t think it too soon, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace&rsquo;s pipe was going out; he held it against his knee and regarded it
      with unconscious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it won&rsquo;t be,&rsquo; said Mr. Lord, &lsquo;when you have found a suitable
      wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but you misunderstand me. I mean that I have decided to marry a
      particular person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who may that be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The younger Miss. French&mdash;Fanny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice quivered over the name; at the end he gave a gasp and a gulp. Of
      a sudden his lips and tongue were very dry, and he felt a disagreeable
      chill running down his back. For the listener&rsquo;s face had altered
      noticeably; it was dark, stern, and something worse. But Mr. Lord could
      still speak with self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have asked her to marry you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have; and she has consented.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace felt his courage returning, like the so-called &lsquo;second wind&rsquo; of a
      runner. It seemed to him that he had gone through the worst. The
      disclosure was made, and had resulted in no outbreak of fury; now he could
      begin to plead his cause. Imagination, excited by nervous stress, brought
      before him a clear picture of the beloved Fanny, with fluffy hair upon her
      forehead and a laugh on her never-closed lips. He spoke without effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought that there would be no harm in asking you to help us. We should
      be quite content to start on a couple of hundred a year&mdash;quite. That
      is only about fifty pounds more than we have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Calf-love inspires many an audacity. To Horace there seemed nothing
      outrageous in this suggestion. He had talked it over with Fanny French
      several times, and they had agreed that his father could not in decency
      offer them <i>less</i> than a hundred a year. He began to shake out the
      ashes from his pipe, with a vague intention of relighting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You really imagine,&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;that I should give you money to
      enable you to marry that idiot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he put a severe restraint upon himself. The veins of his temples
      were congested; his nostrils grew wide; and he spoke rather hoarsely.
      Horace straightened his back, and, though in great fear, strung himself
      for conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;what right&mdash;to insult the young lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His father took him up sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young lady? What do you mean by &ldquo;young lady&rdquo;? After all your education,
      haven&rsquo;t you learnt to distinguish a lady from a dressed-up kitchen wench?
      <i>I</i> had none of your advantages. There was&mdash;there would have
      been some excuse for <i>me</i>, if I had made such a fool of myself. What
      were you doing all those years at school, if it wasn&rsquo;t learning the
      difference between real and sham, getting to understand things better than
      poor folks&rsquo; children? You disappointed me, and a good deal more than I
      ever told you. I had hoped you would come from school better able to make
      a place in the world than your father was. I made up my mind long ago that
      you should never go into my business; you were to be something a good deal
      better. But after all you couldn&rsquo;t, or wouldn&rsquo;t, do what I wanted. Never
      mind&mdash;I said to myself&mdash;never mind; at all events, he has learnt
      to <i>think</i> in a better way than if I had sent him to common schools,
      and after all that&rsquo;s the main thing. But here you come to me and talk of
      marrying a low-bred, low-minded creature, who wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough for
      the meanest clerk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know that, father? What&mdash;what right have you to say such
      things, without knowing more of her than you do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence before Mr. Lord spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very young,&rsquo; he said, with less vehement contempt. &lsquo;I must
      remember that. At your age, a lad has a sort of devil in him, that&rsquo;s
      always driving him out of the path of common sense, whether he will or no.
      I&rsquo;ll try my best to talk quietly with you. Does your sister know what has
      been going on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay she does. I haven&rsquo;t told her in so many words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought of it,&rsquo; pursued Mr. Lord gloomily. &lsquo;I took it for granted
      that everybody must see those people as I myself did. I have wondered now
      and then why Nancy kept up any kind of acquaintance with them, but she
      spoke of them in the rational way, and that seemed enough. I may have
      thought that they might get some sort of good out of <i>her</i>, and I
      felt sure she had too much sense to get harm from <i>them</i>. If it
      hadn&rsquo;t been so, I should have forbidden her to know them at all. What have
      you to say for yourself? I don&rsquo;t want to think worse of you than I need. I
      can make allowance for your age, as I said. What do you see in that girl?
      Just talk to me freely and plainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all you have said,&rsquo; replied Horace, his voice still shaky, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
      the use? You seem to be convinced that there isn&rsquo;t a single good quality
      in her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am. What I want to know is, what good <i>you</i> have found.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great deal, else I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked her to marry me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A vein of stubbornness, unmistakable inheritance from Stephen Lord, had
      begun to appear in the youth&rsquo;s speech and bearing. He kept his head bent,
      and moved it a little from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think her an exception in the family, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a great deal better in every way than her sisters. But I don&rsquo;t
      think as badly of them as you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lord stepped to the door, and out into the passage, where he shouted
      in his deep voice &lsquo;Nancy!&rsquo; The girl quickly appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut the door, please,&rsquo; said her father. All three were now standing
      about the room. &lsquo;Your brother has brought me a piece of news. It ought to
      interest you, I should think. He wants to marry, and out of all the world,
      he has chosen Miss. French&mdash;the youngest.&rsquo; Horace&rsquo;s position was
      trying. He did not know what to do with his hands, and he kept balancing
      now on one foot, now on the other. Nancy had her eyes averted from him,
      but she met her father&rsquo;s look gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I want to ask you,&rsquo; Mr. Lord proceeded, &lsquo;whether you consider Miss.
      French a suitable wife for your brother? Just give me a plain yes or no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the girl, barely subduing the tremor of her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both my children are not fools, thank Heaven! Now tell me, if you can,
      what fault you have to find with the &ldquo;young lady,&rdquo; as your brother calls
      her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For one thing, I don&rsquo;t think her Horace&rsquo;s equal. She can&rsquo;t really be
      called a lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are listening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace bit his lip in mortification, and again his head swung doggedly
      from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might pass over that,&rsquo; added Mr. Lord. &lsquo;What about her character? Is
      there any good point in her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she means any harm. But she&rsquo;s silly, and I&rsquo;ve often thought
      her selfish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are listening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you pretend to be friends with her?&rsquo; he demanded almost
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied his sister, with a note of disdain. &lsquo;We knew each other
      at school, and we haven&rsquo;t altogether broken off, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t all!&rsquo; shouted the young man on a high key. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not
      friendly with her and her sisters, you&rsquo;ve been a great hypocrite. It&rsquo;s
      only just lately you have begun to think yourself too good for them. They
      used to come here, and you went to them; and you talked just like friends
      would do. It&rsquo;s abominable to turn round like this, for the sake of taking
      father&rsquo;s side against me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lord regarded his son contemptuously. There was a rather long silence;
      he spoke at length with severe deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you are ten years older, you&rsquo;ll know a good deal more about young
      women as they&rsquo;re turned out in these times. You&rsquo;ll have heard the talk of
      men who have been fools enough to marry choice specimens. When common
      sense has a chance of getting in a word with you, you&rsquo;ll understand what I
      now tell you. Wherever you look now-a-days there&rsquo;s sham and rottenness;
      but the most worthless creature living is one of these trashy, flashy
      girls,&mdash;the kind of girl you see everywhere, high and low,&mdash;calling
      themselves &ldquo;ladies,&rdquo;&mdash;thinking themselves too good for any honest,
      womanly work. Town and country, it&rsquo;s all the same. They&rsquo;re educated; oh
      yes, they&rsquo;re educated! What sort of wives do they make, with their
      education? What sort of mothers are they? Before long, there&rsquo;ll be no such
      thing as a home. They don&rsquo;t know what the word means. They&rsquo;d like to live
      in hotels, and trollop about the streets day and night. There won&rsquo;t be any
      servants much longer; you&rsquo;re lucky if you find one of the old sort, who
      knows how to light a fire or wash a dish. Go into the houses of men with
      small incomes; what do you find but filth and disorder, quarrelling and
      misery? Young men are bad enough, I know that; they want to begin where
      their fathers left off, and if they can&rsquo;t do it honestly, they&rsquo;ll embezzle
      or forge. But you&rsquo;ll often find there&rsquo;s a worthless wife at the bottom of
      it,&mdash;worrying and nagging because she has a smaller house than some
      other woman, because she can&rsquo;t get silks and furs, and wants to ride in a
      cab instead of an omnibus. It is astounding to me that they don&rsquo;t get
      their necks wrung. Only wait a bit; we shall come to that presently!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rare thing for Stephen Lord to talk at such length. He ceased
      with a bitter laugh, and sat down again in his chair. Horace and his
      sister waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no more to say,&rsquo; fell from their father at length. &lsquo;Go and talk
      about it together, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace moved sullenly towards the door, and with a glance at his sister
      went out. Nancy, after lingering for a moment, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need have any fear of it, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not. But if it isn&rsquo;t that one, it&rsquo;ll be another like her. There&rsquo;s
      not much choice for a lad like Horace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy changed her purpose of leaving the room, and drew a step nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there <i>might</i> have been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lord turned to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make you angry with me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say what you&rsquo;ve got to say,&rsquo; broke in her father impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy, when you so soon lose your temper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My girl,&rsquo;&mdash;for once he gazed at her directly,&mdash;&lsquo;if you knew all
      I have gone through in life, you wouldn&rsquo;t wonder at my temper being
      spoilt.&mdash;What do you mean? What could I have done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him, and spoke with diffidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that if we had lived in a different way, Horace and I
      might have had friends of a better kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A different way?&mdash;I understand. You mean I ought to have had a big
      house, and made a show. Isn&rsquo;t that it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You gave us a good education,&rsquo; replied Nancy, still in the same tone,
      &lsquo;and we might have associated with very different people from those you
      have been speaking of; but education alone isn&rsquo;t enough. One must live as
      the better people do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly. That&rsquo;s your way of thinking. And how do you know that I could
      afford it, to begin with?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to have taken that for granted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not. Young women take a good deal for granted now a-days. But
      supposing you were right, are you silly enough to think that richer people
      are better people, as a matter of course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not as a matter of course,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m quite sure&mdash;I know
      from what I&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;that there&rsquo;s more chance of meeting nice people
      among them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by &ldquo;nice&rdquo;?&rsquo; Mr. Lord was lying back in his chair, and
      spoke thickly, as if wearied. &lsquo;People who can talk so that you forget
      they&rsquo;re only using words they&rsquo;ve learnt like parrots?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Just the contrary. People who have something to say worth listening
      to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll pay less attention to what people say, and
      more to what they do. What&rsquo;s the good of a friend who won&rsquo;t come to see
      you because you live in a small house? That&rsquo;s the plain English of it. If
      I had done as I thought right, I should never have sent you to school at
      all. I should have had you taught at home all that&rsquo;s necessary to make a
      good girl and an honest woman, and have done my best to keep you away from
      the kind of life that I hate. But I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to act as I
      believed. I knew how the times were changing, and I was weak enough to be
      afraid I might do you an injustice. I did give you the chance of making
      friends among better people than your father. Didn&rsquo;t I use to talk to you
      about your school friends, and encourage you when they seemed of the right
      kind? And now you tell me that they don&rsquo;t care for your society because
      you live in a decent, unpretending way. I should think you&rsquo;re better
      without such friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy reflected, seemed about to prolong the argument, but spoke at length
      in another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I will say good-night, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not usual for them to see each other after dinner, so that a
      good-night could seldom be exchanged. The girl, drawing away, expected a
      response; she saw her father nod, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, father,&rsquo; she repeated from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Nancy, good-night,&rsquo; came in impatient reply.

      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Tuesday afternoon, when, beneath a cloudless sky, the great London
      highways reeked and roared in celebration of Jubilee, Nancy and her friend
      Miss. Morgan walked up Grove Lane to Champion Hill. Here and there a house
      had decked itself with colours of loyalty; otherwise the Lane was as quiet
      as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Champion Hill is a gravel byway, overhung with trees; large houses and
      spacious gardens on either hand. Here the heat of the sun was tempered. A
      carriage rolled softly along; a nurse with well-dressed children loitered
      in the shade. One might have imagined it a country road, so profound the
      stillness and so leafy the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago, Jessica Morgan had obtained a three months&rsquo; engagement as
      governess to two little girls, who were sent under her care to the house
      of their grandmother at Teignmouth. Their father, Mr Vawdrey of Champion
      Hill, had recently lost his wife through an illness contracted at a
      horse-race, where the lady sat in wind and rain for some hours. The
      children knew little of what is learnt from books, but were surprisingly
      well informed on matters of which they ought to have known nothing; they
      talked of theatres and race-courses, of &lsquo;the new murderer&rsquo; at Tussaud&rsquo;s,
      of police-news, of notorious spendthrifts and demi-reps; discussed their
      grown-up acquaintances with precocious understanding, and repeated
      scandalous insinuations which could have no meaning for them. Jessica was
      supposed to teach them for two hours daily; she found it an impossibility.
      Nevertheless a liking grew up between her and her charges, and, save by
      their refusal to study, the children gave her no trouble; they were
      abundantly good-natured, they laughed and sported all day long, and did
      their best to put life into the pale, overworked governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst living thus at the seaside, Jessica was delighted by the arrival of
      Nancy Lord, who came to Teignmouth for a summer holiday. With her came
      Mary Woodruff. The faithful servant had been ill; Mr Lord sent her down
      into Devon to make a complete recovery, and to act as Nancy&rsquo;s humble
      chaperon. Nancy&rsquo;s stay was for three weeks. The friends saw a great deal
      of each other, and Miss. Lord had the honour of being presented to Mrs.
      Tarrant, the old lady with whom Jessica lived, Mr. Vawdrey&rsquo;s
      mother-in-law. At the age of three score and ten, Mrs. Tarrant still led
      an active life, and talked with great volubility, chiefly of herself;
      Nancy learnt from her that she had been married at seventeen, and had had
      two children, a son and a daughter, both deceased; of relatives there
      remained to her only Mr Vawdrey and his family, and a grandson, Lionel
      Tarrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as Jessica returned from a ramble with the children, they
      encountered a young man who was greeted, without much fervour, as &lsquo;cousin
      Lionel.&rsquo; Mr. Tarrant professed himself merely a passing visitant; he had
      come to inquire after the health of his grandmother, and in a day or two
      must keep an appointment with friends elsewhere. Notwithstanding this
      announcement, he remained at Teignmouth for a fortnight, exhibiting a
      pious assiduity in his attendance upon the old lady. Naturally, he made
      acquaintance with Miss. Lord, whom his cousins regarded as a great
      acquisition, so vivacious was she, so ready to take part in any kind of
      lively amusement. Mr. Tarrant had been at Oxford; his speech was marked
      with the University accent; he talked little, and seemed to prefer his own
      society. In conversation with Nancy, though scrupulously courteous and
      perfectly good-natured, he never forgot that she was the friend of his
      cousins&rsquo; governess, that their intercourse must be viewed as an irregular
      sort of thing, and that it behoved him to support his dignity whilst
      condescending to a social inferior. So, at all events, it struck Miss.
      Lord, very sensitive in such matters. Fond of fitting people with
      nicknames, she called this young man sometimes &lsquo;His Royal Highness,&rsquo; 
      sometimes &lsquo;His Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Mr. Tarrant&rsquo;s station in life nothing was discovered. His grandmother,
      though seemingly in possession of ample means, betrayed an indifferent
      education, and in her flow of gossip never referred to ancestral
      dignities, never made mention of the calling her husband had pursued. Mr.
      Vawdrey was known to be &lsquo;in business,&rsquo;&mdash;a business which must be
      tolerably lucrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return to London, the children passed from Miss. Morgan&rsquo;s care
      into that of Mrs. Baker, who kept house for the widower at Champion Hill;
      but Jessica did not wholly lose sight of them, and, at their request, she
      persuaded Nancy Lord to make an occasional call with her. Mrs. Baker
      (relict, it was understood, of a military officer who had fallen in
      Eastern warfare) behaved to the young ladies with much friendliness. They
      did not meet Mr. Vawdrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the following year, old Mrs. Tarrant, forsaking Teignmouth, came
      to live under her son-in-law&rsquo;s roof; the winter had tried her health, and
      henceforth she seldom left home.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, as on former occasions (only two or three in all), Nancy was
      reluctant to approach the big house; its imposing front made her feel that
      she came only on sufferance; probably even Mrs. Baker did not regard her
      as having a right to call here on terms of equality. Yet the place touched
      her curiosity and her imagination; she liked to study the luxurious
      appointments within, and to walk about the neglected but pleasant garden,
      quiet and secluded as if whole counties divided it from Camberwell. In the
      hall she and Jessica were at once welcomed by the children, who first
      informed them that tea would be served out of doors, and next made known
      that &lsquo;cousin Lionel&rsquo; was here, in Mrs. Tarrant&rsquo;s drawing-room. The second
      piece of news vexed Nancy; she resolved never to come again, unless on
      formal invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baker, an agreeable woman, received them as if she were the mistress
      of the house. With Jessica she chatted about matters examinational, which
      she seemed thoroughly to understand; with Miss Lord she talked of wider
      subjects, in a tone not unpleasing to Nancy, seeing that it presumed, on
      her part, some knowledge of the polite world. It was observable that Mr.
      Vawdrey&rsquo;s daughters had benefited by the superintendence of this lady;
      they no longer gossiped loudly about murders and scandals, but demeaned
      themselves more as became their years.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of other ladies to call upon Mrs. Baker, the children drew
      their friends away into the garden, where tea now awaited them. Amid the
      trees and flowers time passed not unpleasantly, until, on happening to
      turn her head, Nancy perceived at a distance the approaching figure of Mr.
      Lionel Tarrant. He sauntered over the grass with easy, indolent step; his
      straw hat and light lounge costume (excellent tailoring) suited the season
      and the place. Jessica, who regarded the young man with something of awe,
      stood up to shake hands, but Miss. Lord kept her place in the garden
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see the procession?&rsquo; Tarrant inquired. &lsquo;Ah, then I can give you
      very important news&mdash;thrilling news. I know the colour of the Queen&rsquo;s
      bonnet, and of her parasol.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were of pale primrose. Touching, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seated himself crosswise on a camp-stool, and seemed to be admiring
      the contour of his brown boots. Lionel&rsquo;s age was not more than
      seven-and-twenty; he enjoyed sound health, and his face signified
      contentment with the scheme of things as it concerned himself; but a
      chronic languor possessed him. It might be sheer laziness, possibly a
      result of that mental habit, discernible In his look, whereby he had come
      to regard his own judgment as the criterion of all matters in heaven and
      earth. Yet the conceit which relaxed his muscles was in the main amiable;
      it never repelled as does the conceit of a fop or a weakling or a vulgar
      person; he could laugh heartily, even with his own affectations for a
      source of amusement. Of personal vanity he had little, though women
      esteemed him good-looking; his steady, indolent gaze made denial of such
      preoccupation. Nor could he be regarded as emasculate; his movements
      merely disguised the natural vigour of a manly frame, and his
      conversational trifling hinted an intellectual reserve, a latent power of
      mind, obvious enough in the lines of his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was excusable for supposing that he viewed her slightingly. He spoke
      as one who did not expect to be quite understood by such a hearer,
      addressing her, without the familiarity, much as he addressed his young
      cousins. To her, his careful observance of formalities seemed the reverse
      of flattering; she felt sure that with young women in his own circle he
      would allow himself much more freedom. Whether the disparagement applied
      to her intellect or to her social status might be a question; Nancy could
      not decide which of the two she would prefer. Today an especial uneasiness
      troubled her from the first moment of his appearance; she felt a stronger
      prompting than hitherto to assert herself, and, if possible, to surprise
      Mr. Tarrant. But, as if he understood her thought, his manner became only
      more bland, his calm aloofness more pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, who were never at ease in their cousin&rsquo;s presence, succeeded
      in drawing Jessica apart, and chattered to her about the educational
      methods imposed by Mrs. Baker, airing many grievances. They nourished a
      hope that Miss. Morgan might again become their governess; lessons down at
      Teignmouth had been nothing like so oppressive as here at Champion Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant, meanwhile, having drunk a cup of tea, and touched his moustache
      with a silk handkerchief, transferred himself from the camp-stool to the
      basket chair vacated by Jessica. He was now further from Nancy, but facing
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been talking with Mrs. Bellamy,&rsquo; fell from him, in the same tone
      of idle good nature. &lsquo;Do you know her? She has but one subject of
      conversation; an engrossing topic, to be sure; namely, her servants. Do
      you give much thought to the great servant question? I have my own modest
      view of the matter. It may not be novel, but my mind has worked upon it in
      the night watches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, resolved not to smile, found herself smiling. Not so much at what
      he said, as at the manner of it. Her resentment was falling away; she felt
      the influence of this imperturbable geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I tell you my theory?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked with less reserve than on the last occasion when they had sat
      together. The mellow sunlight, the garden odours, the warm, still air,
      favoured a growth of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; was Nancy&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must begin by admitting that the ordinary woman hates nothing so much
      as to have another woman set in authority over her.&rsquo; He paused, and
      laughed lazily. &lsquo;Now, before the triumph of glorious Democracy, only those
      women kept servants who were capable of rule,&mdash;who had by birth the
      instinct of authority. They knew themselves the natural superiors of their
      domestics, and went through an education fitting them to rule. Things
      worked very well; no servant-difficulty existed. Now-a-days, every woman
      who can afford it must have another woman to wait upon her, no matter how
      silly, or vulgar, or depraved she may be; the result, of course, is a
      spirit of rebellion in the kitchen. Who could have expected anything
      else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy played with a dandelion she had plucked, and gave sign neither of
      assent nor disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bellamy,&rsquo; continued the young man, &lsquo;marvels that servants revolt
      against her. What could be more natural? The servants have learnt that
      splendid doctrine that every one is as good as everybody else, and Mrs.
      Bellamy is by no means the person to make them see things differently. And
      this kind of thing is going on in numberless houses&mdash;an utterly
      incompetent mistress and a democratic maid in spirited revolt. The
      incompetents, being in so vast a majority, will sooner or later spoil all
      the servants in the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should make an article of it,&rsquo; said Nancy, &lsquo;and send it to <i>The
      Nineteenth Century</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I might.&rsquo; He paused, and added casually, &lsquo;You read <i>The Nineteenth
      Century</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now and then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy felt herself an impostor, for of leading reviews she knew little
      more than the names. And Tarrant&rsquo;s look, so steady, yet so good-tempered,
      disturbed her conscience with the fear that he saw through her. She was
      coming wretchedly out of this dialogue, in which she had meant to make a
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed the subject; was it merely to spare her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall you go to Teignmouth again this year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I think not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence followed. Tarrant, to judge from his face, was absorbed in
      pleasant thought; Nancy, on the other hand, felt so ill at ease that she
      was on the point of rising, when his voice checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have an idea&rsquo;&mdash;he spoke dreamily&mdash;&lsquo;of going to spend next
      winter in the Bahamas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the Bahamas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking with all the carelessness she could command, Nancy shivered a
      little. Spite of her &lsquo;culture,&rsquo; she had but the vaguest notion where the
      Bahamas were. To betray ignorance would be dreadful. A suspicion awoke in
      her that Tarrant, surprised by her seeming familiarity with current
      literature, was craftily testing the actual quality of her education. Upon
      the shiver followed a glow, and, in fear lest her cheeks would redden, she
      grew angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Partly because it is a delightful winter climate; partly because I have a
      friend there; partly because the islands are interesting. A man I knew at
      Oxford has gone out there, and is likely to stay. His father owns nearly
      the whole of an island; and as he&rsquo;s in very bad health, my friend may soon
      come into possession. When he does, he&rsquo;s going to astonish the natives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A vision of savages flashed before Nancy&rsquo;s mind. She breathed more freely,
      thinking the danger past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Simply by making a fortune out of an estate that is lying all but barren.
      Before the emancipation of the niggers, the Bahamas flourished
      wonderfully; now they are fallen to decay, and ruled, so far as I
      understand it, by a particularly contemptible crew of native whites, who
      ought all to be kicked into the sea. My friend&rsquo;s father is a man of no
      energy; he calls himself magistrate, coroner, superintendent of the
      customs, and a dozen other things, but seems to have spent his time for
      years in lying about, smoking and imbibing. His son, I&rsquo;m afraid, waits
      impatiently for the old man&rsquo;s removal to a better world. He believes there
      are immense possibilities of trade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying hard to recollect her geography, Miss. Lord affected but a slight
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no direct way of getting there,&rsquo; Tarrant pursued. &lsquo;What route
      should you suggest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was right, after all. He wished to convict her of ignorance. Her
      cheeks were now burning, beyond a doubt, and she felt revengeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I advise you to make inquiries at a shipping-office,&rsquo; was her distant
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems&rsquo;&mdash;he was smiling at Nancy&mdash;&lsquo;I shall have to go to New
      York, and then take the Cuba mail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to join your friend in business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Business, I fear, is hardly my vocation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tremor on Nancy&rsquo;s lips, and about her eyelids. She said
      abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were perhaps in business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you? What suggested it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant looked fixedly at her; in his expression, as in his voice, she
      detected a slight disdain, and that decided her to the utterance of the
      next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&rsquo;&mdash;she had assumed an ingenuous air&mdash;&lsquo;there&rsquo;s the Black Lead
      that bears your name. Haven&rsquo;t you something to do with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She durst not watch him, but a change of his countenance was distinctly
      perceptible, and for the moment caused her a keen gratification. His eyes
      had widened, his lips had set themselves; he looked at once startled and
      mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black lead?&rsquo; The words fell slowly, in a voice unlike that she had been
      hearing. &lsquo;No. I have nothing to do with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was dreadful. Nancy endeavoured to rise, but her limbs would
      not do their office. Then, her eyes fixed on the grass, she became aware
      that Tarrant himself had stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are the children?&rsquo; he was saying absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descried them afar off with Miss. Morgan, and began to saunter in that
      direction. As soon as his back was turned, Nancy rose and began to walk
      towards the house. In a few moments Jessica and the girls were with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we must go,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered, and took leave of Mrs. Baker, who sat alone in the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you say good-bye to Mr. Tarrant?&rsquo; Jessica asked, as they came forth
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t. But I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had thought of telling her friend what she had done, of boasting
      that she had asked the impossible question. But now she felt ashamed of
      herself, and something more than ashamed. Never again could she enter this
      garden. And it seemed to her that, by a piece of outrageous, of wanton,
      folly, she had for ever excluded herself from the society of all
      &lsquo;superior&rsquo; people.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, <i>I</i> look at it in this way. It&rsquo;s to celebrate the fiftieth year
      of the reign of Queen Victoria&mdash;yes: but at the same time, and far
      more, it&rsquo;s to celebrate the completion of fifty years of Progress.
      National Progress, without precedent in the history of mankind! One may
      say, indeed, Progress of the Human Race. Only think what has been done in
      this half-century: only think of it! Compare England now, compare the
      world, with what it was in 1837. It takes away one&rsquo;s breath!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Mr. Samuel Bennett Barmby, as he stood swaying forward upon his toes,
      his boots creaking. Nancy and Jessica listened to him. They were ready to
      start on the evening&rsquo;s expedition, but Horace had not yet come home, and
      on the chance of his arrival they would wait a few minutes longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall make this the subject of a paper for our Society next winter&mdash;the
      Age of Progress. And with special reference to one particular&mdash;the
      Press. Only think now, of the difference between our newspapers, all our
      periodicals of to-day, and those fifty years ago. Did you ever really
      consider, Miss. Morgan, what a marvellous thing one of our great
      newspapers really is? Printed in another way it would make a volume&mdash;absolutely;
      a positive volume; packed with thought and information. And all for the
      ridiculous price of one penny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed; a high, chuckling, crowing laugh; the laugh of triumphant
      optimism. Of the man&rsquo;s sincerity there could be no question; it beamed
      from his shining forehead, his pointed nose; glistened in his prominent
      eyes. He had a tall, lank figure, irreproachably clad in a suit of grey:
      frock coat, and waistcoat revealing an expanse of white shirt. His cuffs
      were magnificent, and the hands worthy of them. A stand-up collar, of
      remarkable stiffness, kept his head at the proper level of self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye, Miss. Lord, are you aware that the Chinese Empire, with four
      <i>hundred</i> MILLION inhabitants, has only <i>ten</i> daily papers?
      Positively; only ten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it stated in a paper. That helps one to <i>grasp</i> the difference
      between civilisation and barbarism. One doesn&rsquo;t think clearly enough of
      common things. Now that&rsquo;s one of the benefits one gets from Carlyle.
      Carlyle teaches one to see the marvellous in everyday life. Of course in
      many things I don&rsquo;t agree with him, but I shall never lose an opportunity
      of expressing my gratitude to Carlyle. Carlyle and Gurty! Yes, Carlyle and
      Gurty; those two authors are an education in themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered a long &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and moved his lips as if savouring a delicious
      morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now here&rsquo;s an interesting thing. If all the cabs in London were put end
      to end,&rsquo;&mdash;he paused between the words, gravely,&mdash;&lsquo;what do you
      think, Miss. Morgan, would be the total length?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I have no idea, Mr. Barmby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forty miles&mdash;positively! Forty miles of cabs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it stated in a paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls glanced at each other, and smiled. Barmby beamed upon them with
      the benevolence of a man who knew his advantages, personal and social.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this moment Horace Lord came in. He had not the fresh appearance
      which usually distinguished him; his face was stained with perspiration,
      his collar had become limp, the flower at his buttonhole hung faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here I am. Are you going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you know you have kept us waiting,&rsquo; said his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Awf&rsquo;ly sorry. Couldn&rsquo;t get here before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as if he had not altogether the command of his tongue, and with a
      fixed meaningless smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better not delay,&rsquo; said Barmby, taking up his hat. &lsquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock.
      We ought to be at Charing Cross before eight; that will allow us about
      three hours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They set forth at once. By private agreement between the girls, Jessica
      Morgan attached herself to Mr. Barmby, allowing Nancy to follow with her
      brother, as they walked rapidly towards Camberwell Green. Horace kept
      humming popular airs; his hat had fallen a little to the side, and he
      swung his cane carelessly. His sister asked him what he had been doing all
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, going about. I met some fellows after the procession. We had a
      splendid view, up there on the top of Waterloo House.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Fanny go home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We met her sisters, and had some lunch at a restaurant. Look here; you
      don&rsquo;t want me to-night. You won&rsquo;t mind if I get lost in the crowd? Barmby
      will be quite enough to take care of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are going to meet her again, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better agree on a rendezvous at a certain time. I say, Barmby,
      just a moment; if any of us should get separated, we had better know where
      to meet, for coming home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no fear of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, it <i>might</i> happen. There&rsquo;ll be a tremendous crush, you
      know. Suppose we say the place where the trams stop, south of Westminster
      Bridge, and the time a quarter to eleven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Camberwell Green they mingled with a confused rush of hilarious crowds,
      amid a clattering of cabs and omnibuses, a jingling of tram-car bells.
      Public-houses sent forth their alcoholic odours upon the hot air. Samuel
      Barmby, joyous in his protectorship of two young ladies, for he regarded
      Horace as a mere boy, bustled about them whilst they stood waiting for the
      arrival of the Westminster car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be a gallant rush! You would rather be outside, wouldn&rsquo;t
      you, Miss. Lord? Here it comes: charge!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the charge was ineffectual for their purpose. A throng of far more
      resolute and more sinewy people swept them aside, and seized every vacant
      place on the top of the vehicle. Only with much struggle did they obtain
      places within. In an ordinary mood, Nancy would have resented this
      hustling of her person by the profane public; as it was, she half enjoyed
      the tumult, and looked forward to get more of it along the packed streets,
      with a sense that she might as well amuse herself in vulgar ways, since
      nothing better was attainable. This did not, however, modify her contempt
      of Samuel Barmby; it seemed never to have occurred to him that the
      rough-and-tumble might be avoided, and time gained, by the simple
      expedient of taking a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting opposite to Samuel, she avoided his persistent glances by reading
      the rows of advertisements above his head. Somebody&rsquo;s &lsquo;Blue;&rsquo; somebody&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Soap;&rsquo; somebody&rsquo;s &lsquo;High-class Jams;&rsquo; and behold, inserted between the
      Soap and the Jam&mdash;&lsquo;God so loved the world, that He gave His
      only-begotten Son, that whoso believeth in Him should not perish, but have
      everlasting life.&rsquo; Nancy perused the passage without perception of
      incongruity, without emotion of any kind. Her religion had long since
      fallen to pieces, and universal defilement of Scriptural phrase by the
      associations of the market-place had in this respect blunted her
      sensibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby was talking to Jessica Morgan. She caught his words now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you tell me what is the smallest tree in the world?&mdash;No, it&rsquo;s
      the Greenland birch. Its full-grown height is only three inches&mdash;positively!
      But it spreads over several feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was tempted to lean forward and say, &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; But the jest
      seemed to involve her in too much familiarity with Mr Barmby; for her own
      peace it was better to treat him with all possible coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman near her talked loudly about the procession, with special
      reference to a personage whom she called &lsquo;Prince of Wiles.&rsquo; This
      enthusiast declared with pride that she had stood at a certain street
      corner for seven hours, accompanied by a child of five years old, the same
      who now sat on her lap, nodding in utter weariness; together they were
      going to see the illuminations, and walk about, with intervals devoted to
      refreshments, for several hours more. Beyond sat a working-man, overtaken
      with liquor, who railed vehemently at the Jubilee, and in no measured
      terms gave his opinion of our Sovereign Lady; the whole thing was a &lsquo;lay,&rsquo; 
      an occasion for filling the Royal pocket, and it had succeeded to the tune
      of something like half a million of money, wheedled, most of it, from the
      imbecile poor. &lsquo;Shut up!&rsquo; roared a loyalist, whose patience could endure
      no longer. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let a boozing blackguard like you talk in
      that way about &lsquo;er Majesty!&rsquo; Thereupon, retort of insult, challenge to
      combat, clamour from many throats, deep and shrill. Nancy laughed, and
      would rather have enjoyed it if the men had fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Westminster Bridge all jumped confusedly into the street and ran for
      the pavement. It was still broad daylight; the sun&mdash;a potentate who
      keeps no Jubilee&mdash;dropping westward amid the hues of summer eventide,
      was unmarked, for all his splendour, by the roaring multitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going to leave us?&rsquo; Nancy inquired of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charing Cross, or somewhere about there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep by me till then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby was endeavouring to secure her companionship. He began to cross the
      bridge at her side, but Nancy turned and bade him attend upon Miss.
      Morgan, saying that she wished to talk with her brother. In this order
      they moved towards Parliament Street, where the crowd began to thicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now let us decide upon our route,&rsquo; exclaimed Barmby, with the air of a
      popular leader planning a great demonstration. &lsquo;Miss. Lord, we will be
      directed by your wishes. Where would you like to be when the lighting-up
      begins?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care. What does it matter? Let us go straight on and see whatever
      comes in our way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the right spirit! Let us give ourselves up to the occasion! We
      can&rsquo;t be wrong in making for Trafalgar Square. Advance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed upon a group of reeling lads and girls, who yelled in chorus
      the popular song of the day, a sentimental one as it happened&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Do not forget me, Do not forget me, Think sometimes of me still</i>&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was working herself into a nervous, excited state. She felt it
      impossible to walk on and on under Barmby&rsquo;s protection, listening to his
      atrocious commonplaces, his enthusiasms of the Young Men&rsquo;s Debating
      Society. The glow of midsummer had entered into her blood; she resolved to
      taste independence, to mingle with the limitless crowd as one of its
      units, borne in whatever direction. That song of the streets pleased her,
      made sympathetic appeal to her; she would have liked to join in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just behind her&mdash;it was on the broad pavement at Whitehall&mdash;some
      one spoke her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord! Why, who would have expected to see you here? Shouldn&rsquo;t have
      dared to think of such a thing; upon my word, I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of about thirty, dressed without much care, middle-sized, wiry,
      ruddy of cheek, and his coarse but strong features vivid with festive
      energy, held a hand to her. Luckworth Crewe was his name. Nancy had come
      to know him at the house of Mrs. Peachey, where from time to time she had
      met various people unrecognised in her own home. His tongue bewrayed him
      for a native of some northern county; his manner had no polish, but a
      genuine heartiness which would have atoned for many defects. Horace, who
      also knew him, offered a friendly greeting; but Samuel Barmby, when the
      voice caught his ear, regarded this intruder with cold surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I walk on with you?&rsquo; Crewe asked, when he saw that Miss. Lord felt no
      distaste for his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy deigned not even a glance at her nominal protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are going our way,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby, his dignity unobserved, strode on with Miss. Morgan, of whom he
      sought information concerning the loud-voiced man. Crewe talked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve come out to have a look at it, after all. I saw the Miss
      Frenches last Sunday, and they told me you cared no more for the Jubilee
      than for a dog-fight. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t surprised; you&rsquo;ve other things to
      think about. But it&rsquo;s worth seeing, that&rsquo;s my opinion. Were you out this
      morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I don&rsquo;t care for Royalties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more do I. Expensive humbugs, that&rsquo;s what I call &lsquo;em. But I had a look
      at them, for all that. The Crown Prince was worth seeing; yes, he really
      was. I&rsquo;m not so prejudiced as to deny that. He&rsquo;s the kind of chap I should
      like to get hold of, and have a bit of a talk with, and ask him what he
      thought about things in general. It&rsquo;s been a big affair, hasn&rsquo;t it? I know
      a chap who made a Jubilee Perfume, and he&rsquo;s netting something like a
      hundred pounds a day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any Jubilee speculation on hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me! It makes me mad. I had a really big thing,&mdash;a Jubilee
      Drink,&mdash;a teetotal beverage; the kind of thing that would have sold
      itself, this weather. A friend of mine hit on it, a clerk in a City
      warehouse, one of the cleverest chaps I ever knew. It really was <i>the</i>
      drink; I&rsquo;ve never tasted anything like it. Why, there&rsquo;s the biggest
      fortune on record waiting for the man who can supply <i>the</i> drink for
      total-abstainers. And this friend of mine had it. He gave me some to taste
      one night, about a month ago, and I roared with delight. It was all
      arranged. I undertook to find enough capital to start with, and to manage
      the concern. I would have given up my work with Bullock and Freeman. I&rsquo;d
      have gone in, tooth and nail, for that drink! I sat up all one night
      trying to find a name for it; but couldn&rsquo;t hit on the right one. A name is
      just as important as the stuff itself that you want to sell. Next morning&mdash;it
      was Sunday&mdash;I went round to my friend&rsquo;s lodgings, and&rsquo;&mdash;he
      slapped his thigh&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m blest if the chap hadn&rsquo;t cut his throat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Betting and forgery. He would have been arrested next day. But the worst
      of it was that his beverage perished with him. I hadn&rsquo;t a notion how it
      was made; he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me till I planked down money to start with; and
      not a drop of it could be found anywhere. And to think that he had
      absolutely struck oil, as they say; had nothing to do but sit down and
      count the money as it came in! That&rsquo;s the third man I&rsquo;ve known go wrong in
      less than a year. Betting and embezzlement; betting and burglary; betting
      and forgery. I&rsquo;ll tell you some time about the chap who went in for
      burglary. One of the best fellows I ever knew; when he comes out, I must
      give him a hand. But ten to one he&rsquo;ll burgle again; they always do;
      burglary grows on a man, like drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His laughter rang across the street; Barmby, who kept looking back,
      surprised and indignant that this acquaintance of Miss. Lord&rsquo;s was not
      presented to him, paused for a moment, but Nancy waved to him
      commandingly, &lsquo;Straight on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Charing Cross. Horace, who took no part in the conversation,
      and had dropped behind, at this point found an opportunity of stealing
      away. It was Crewe who first remarked his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo! where&rsquo;s your brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone, evidently.&mdash;Hush! Don&rsquo;t say anything. Will you do something
      for me, Mr. Crewe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I will. What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy pursued in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone to meet Fanny French. At least, he told me so; but I want to
      know whether it is really Fanny, or some one else. He said they were to
      meet in front of the Haymarket Theatre. Will you go as quickly as you can,
      and see if Fanny is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like a bird!&mdash;But how am I to meet you again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be at the top of Regent Street at nine o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;by Peter
      Robinson&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t lose time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck off in the westerly direction, and Barmby, looking round at that
      moment, saw him go. Engrossed in thought of Nancy, Samuel did not yet
      perceive that her brother had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your friend isn&rsquo;t coming any further?&rsquo; he said, in a tone of forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where&rsquo;s Mr. Lord?&rsquo; exclaimed Jessica.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy pretended to look back for him, and for a minute or two they waited.
      Barmby, glad to be delivered from both male companions, made light of the
      matter; Horace could take care of himself; they had the appointment for a
      quarter to eleven;&mdash;on! And he now fixed himself resolutely at
      Nancy&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, delighted with the success of her stratagem, and careless of what
      might result from it, behaved more companionably. To Luckworth Crewe&rsquo;s
      society she had no objection; indeed, she rather liked him; but his
      presence would have hindered the escape for which she was preparing. Poor
      Jessica might feel it something of a hardship to pass hours alone with
      &lsquo;the Prophet,&rsquo; but that could not be helped. Nancy would be free to-night,
      if never again. They turned into the Strand, and Barmby voiced his opinion
      of the public decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s very little of what can be called Art,&mdash;very little indeed.
      I&rsquo;m afraid we haven&rsquo;t made much progress in Art.&mdash;Now what would
      Ruskin say to this kind of thing? The popular taste wants educating. My
      idea is that we ought to get a few leading men Burne Jones and&mdash;and
      William Morris&mdash;and people of that kind, you know, Miss. Lord,&mdash;to
      give lectures in a big hall on the elements of Art. A great deal might be
      done in that way, don&rsquo;t you think so, Miss. Morgan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no faith in anything popular,&rsquo; Jessica replied loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. But, after all, the people have got the upper hand now-a-days,
      and we who enjoy advantages of education, of culture, ought not to allow
      them to remain in darkness. It isn&rsquo;t for our own interest, most decidedly
      it isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did your sisters go to see the procession?&rsquo; Nancy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, they were afraid of the crowd. The old gentleman took them out to
      Tooting Common this afternoon, and they enjoyed themselves. Perhaps I
      should have been wiser if I had imitated their example; I mean this
      morning; of course I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this evening for anything
      whatever. But somehow, one feels it a sort of duty to see something of
      these great public holidays. I caught a glimpse of the procession. In its
      way it was imposing&mdash;yes, really. After all, the Monarchy is a great
      <i>fact</i>&mdash;as Gurty would have said. I like to keep my mind open to
      facts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set, and with approach of dusk the crowds grew denser. Nancy
      proposed a return westwards; the clubs of Pall Mall and of St James&rsquo;s
      Street would make a display worth seeing, and they must not miss
      Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little later,&rsquo; said their escort, with an air of liberality, &lsquo;we must
      think of some light refreshment. We shall be passing a respectable
      restaurant, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight began to obscure the distance. Here and there a house-front
      slowly marked itself with points of flame, shaping to wreath, festoon, or
      initials of Royalty. Nancy looked eagerly about her, impatient for the
      dark, wishing the throng would sweep her away. In Pall Mall, Barmby felt
      it incumbent upon him to name the several clubs, a task for which he was
      inadequately prepared. As he stood staring in doubt at one of the coldly
      insolent facades, Jessica gazing in the same direction, Nancy saw that her
      moment had come. She darted off, struggled through a moving crowd, and
      reached the opposite pavement. All she had now to do was to press onward
      with the people around her; save by chance, she could not possibly be
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarm at her daring troubled her for a few minutes. As a matter of course
      Barmby would report this incident to her father,&mdash;unless she plainly
      asked him not to do so, for which she had no mind. Yet what did it matter?
      She had escaped to enjoy herself, and the sense of freedom soon overcame
      anxieties. No one observed her solitary state; she was one of millions
      walking about the streets because it was Jubilee Day, and every moment
      packed her more tightly among the tramping populace. A procession, this,
      greatly more significant than that of Royal personages earlier in the day.
      Along the main thoroughfares of mid-London, wheel-traffic was now
      suspended; between the houses moved a double current of humanity, this way
      and that, filling the whole space, so that no vehicle could possibly have
      made its way on the wonted track. At junctions, pickets of police directed
      progress; the slowly advancing masses wheeled to left or right at word of
      command, carelessly obedient. But for an occasional bellow of hilarious
      blackguardism, or for a song uplifted by strident voices, or a cheer at
      some flaring symbol that pleased the passers, there was little noise; only
      a thud, thud of footfalls numberless, and the low, unvarying sound that
      suggested some huge beast purring to itself in stupid contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy forgot her identity, lost sight of herself as an individual. Her
      blood was heated by close air and physical contact. She did not think, and
      her emotions differed little from those of any shop-girl let loose. The
      &lsquo;culture,&rsquo; to which she laid claim, evanesced in this atmosphere of
      exhalations. Could she have seen her face, its look of vulgar abandonment
      would have horrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one trod violently on her heel, and she turned with a half-angry
      laugh, protesting. &lsquo;Beg your pardon, miss,&rsquo; said a young fellow of the
      clerkly order. &lsquo;A push be&rsquo;ind made me do it.&rsquo; He thrust himself to a place
      beside her, and Nancy conversed with him unrestrainedly, as though it were
      a matter of course. The young man, scrutinising her with much freedom,
      shaped clerkly compliments, and, in his fashion, grew lyrical; until, at a
      certain remark which he permitted himself, Nancy felt it time to shake him
      off. Her next encounter was more noteworthy. Of a sudden she felt an arm
      round her waist, and a man, whose breath declared the source of his
      inspiration, began singing close to her ear the operatic ditty, &lsquo;Queen of
      my Heart.&rsquo; He had, moreover, a good tenor voice, and belonged, vaguely, to
      some stratum of educated society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better leave me alone,&rsquo; said Nancy, looking him severely
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you really think so,&rsquo;&mdash;he seemed struck by her manner of
      speech,&mdash;&lsquo;of course I will: but I&rsquo;d much rather not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might find it necessary to speak to a policeman at the next corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, in that case.&rsquo;&mdash;He raised his hat, and fell aside. And Nancy
      felt that, after all, the adventure had been amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now in Regent Street, and it came to her recollection that she had
      made an appointment with Luckworth Crewe for nine o&rsquo;clock. Without any
      intention of keeping it; but why not do so? Her lively acquaintance would
      be excellent company for the next hour, until she chose to bring the
      escapade to an end. And indeed, save by a disagreeable struggle, she could
      hardly change the direction of her steps. It was probably past nine; Crewe
      might have got tired of waiting, or have found it impossible to keep a
      position on the pavement. Drawing near to the top of Regent Street, she
      hoped he might be there. And there he was, jovially perspiring; he saw her
      between crowded heads, and crushed through to her side.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are your friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s more than I can tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle we&rsquo;ve been able to meet,&rsquo; said Crewe. &lsquo;I had to thrash a
      fellow five minutes ago, and was precious near getting run in. Shall we go
      the Tottenham Court Road way? Look out! You&rsquo;d better hold on to my arm.
      These big crossings are like whirlpools; you might go round and round, and
      never get anywhere. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; if any one runs up against you, I&rsquo;ll
      knock him down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be room for him to fall,&rsquo; said Nancy, wild with merriment,
      as they swayed amid the uproar. For the first time she understood how
      perilous such a crowd might be. A band of roisterers, linked arm in arm,
      were trying to break up the orderly march of thousands into a chaotic
      fight. The point for which Crewe made was unattainable; just in front of
      him a woman began shrieking hysterically; another fainted, and dropped
      into her neighbour&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get frightened!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I! I like it. It&rsquo;s good fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the right sort, you are. But we must get out of this. It&rsquo;s worse
      than the pit-door on the first night of a pantomime. I must hold you up;
      don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His arm encircled her body, and for a moment now and then he carried
      rather than led her. They were safe at length, in the right part of Oxford
      Street, and moving with the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find your brother,&rsquo; Crewe had leisure to say; &lsquo;and I didn&rsquo;t
      see Fanny French. There weren&rsquo;t many people about just then, either. They
      must have gone off before I came.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they must. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have some life in you.&rsquo; He gazed at her admiringly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re worth
      half a million of the girls that squeak and wobble when there&rsquo;s a bit of
      rough play going on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so. Did you set me down as one of that kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy found that her tongue had achieved a liberty suitable to the
      occasion. She spoke without forethought, and found pleasure in her
      boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; Crewe answered. &lsquo;But I never had a chance before now of telling
      you what I thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one in front of them ignited a Bengal light and threw it into the
      air; the flame flashed across Nancy&rsquo;s features, and fell upon the hat of a
      man near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean to get home?&rsquo; asked Crewe presently. Nancy explained that
      all her party were to meet on the other side of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, then, there&rsquo;s plenty of time. When you&rsquo;ve had enough of this kind of
      thing we can strike off into the quiet streets. If you were a man, which
      I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not, I should say I was choking for a glass of beer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say it, and look for a place where you can quench your thirst.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be a place, then, where you can come in as well. You don&rsquo;t drink
      beer, of course, but we can get lemonade and that kind of thing. No wonder
      we get thirsty; look up there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the direction of his eyes, Nancy saw above the heads of the
      multitude a waving dust-canopy, sent up by myriad tramplings on the
      sun-scorched streets. Glare of gas illumined it in the foreground; beyond,
      it dimmed all radiance like a thin fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might cut across through Soho,&rsquo; he pursued, &lsquo;and get among the
      restaurants. Take my arm again. Only a bit of cross-fighting, and we shall
      be in the crowd going the other way. Did you do physics at school?
      Remember about the resultant of forces? Now <i>we</i>&rsquo;re a force tending
      to the right, and the crowd is a force making for straight on; to find the&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His hat was knocked over his eyes, and the statement of the problem ended
      in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a good deal of difficulty they reached one of the southward byways;
      and thenceforth walking was unimpeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that I call myself Luckworth Crewe,&rsquo; resumed Nancy&rsquo;s companion
      after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, the fact is, I&rsquo;ve no right to either of the names. I thought I&rsquo;d
      just tell you, for the fun of the thing; I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about it to any
      one else that I know. They tell me I was picked up on a doorstep in Leeds,
      and the wife of a mill-hand adopted me. Their name was Crewe. They called
      me Tom, but somehow it isn&rsquo;t a name I care for, and when I was grown up I
      met a man called Luckworth, who was as kind as a father to me, and so I
      took his name in place of Tom. That&rsquo;s the long and short of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked a trifle disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t think any worse of me, because I haven&rsquo;t a name of my own?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I? It isn&rsquo;t your fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. But I&rsquo;m not the kind of man to knuckle under. I think myself just as
      good as anybody else I&rsquo;ll knock the man down that sneers at me; and I
      won&rsquo;t thank anybody for pitying me; that&rsquo;s the sort of chap I am. And I&rsquo;m
      going to have a big fortune one of these days. It&rsquo;s down in the books. I
      know I shall live to be a rich man, just as well as I know that I&rsquo;m
      walking down Dean Street with Miss. Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think it very possible,&rsquo; his companion remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It hasn&rsquo;t begun yet. I can only lay my hand on a few hundred pounds, one
      way and another. And I&rsquo;m turned thirty. But the next ten years are going
      to do it. Do you know what I did last Saturday? I got fifteen hundred
      pounds&rsquo; worth of advertising for our people, from a chap that&rsquo;s never yet
      put a penny into the hands of an agent. I went down and talked to him like
      a father. He was the hardest nut I ever had to crack, but in thirty-five
      minutes I&rsquo;d got him&mdash;like a roach on a hook. And it&rsquo;ll be to his
      advantage, mind you. That fifteen hundred &lsquo;ll bring him in more business
      than he&rsquo;s had for ten years past. I got him to confess he was going down
      the hill. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because you don&rsquo;t know how to advertise,
      and won&rsquo;t let anybody else know for you?&rdquo; In a few minutes he was telling
      me he&rsquo;d dropped more than a thousand on a patent that was out of date
      before it got fairly going. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your new
      cooking-stove. You&rsquo;ve dropped a thousand on the other thing; give your
      advertising to us, and I&rsquo;ll guarantee you shall come home on the
      cooking-stove.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come home on it?&rsquo; Nancy inquired, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s our way of talking,&rsquo; said the other, with his hearty laugh. &lsquo;It
      means to make up one&rsquo;s loss. And he&rsquo;ll do it. And when he has, he&rsquo;ll think
      no end of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not long ago, I boxed a chap for his advertising. A fair turn-up with the
      gloves. Do you suppose I licked him? Not I; though I could have done it
      with one hand. I just let him knock me out of time, and two minutes after
      he put all his business into my hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get rich,&rsquo; declared Nancy, laughing. &lsquo;No doubt about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a spot down the South Western Railway where we wanted to stick
      up a board, a great big board, as ugly as they make &lsquo;em. It was in a man&rsquo;s
      garden; a certain particular place, where the trains slow, and folks have
      time to read the advertisement and meditate on it. That chap wouldn&rsquo;t
      listen. What! spoil his garden with our da&mdash;&mdash;with our
      confounded board! not for five hundred a year! Well, I went down, and I
      talked to him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like a father,&rsquo; put in Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so, like a father. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my dear sir, you&rsquo;re
      impeding the progress of civilisation. How could we have become what we
      are without the modern science and art of advertising? Till advertising
      sprang up, the world was barbarous. Do you suppose people kept themselves
      clean before they were reminded at every corner of the benefits of soap?
      Do you suppose they were healthy before every wall and hoarding told them
      what medicine to take for their ailments? Not they indeed! Why, a man like
      you&mdash;an enlightened man, I see it in your face (he was as ugly as
      Ben&rsquo;s bull-dog), ought to be proud of helping on the age.&rdquo; And I made him
      downright ashamed of himself. He asked me to have a bit of dinner, and we
      came to terms over the cheese.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this strain did Luckworth Crewe continue to talk across the gloomy
      solitudes of Soho. And Nancy would on no account have had him cease. She
      was fascinated by his rough vigour and by his visions of golden
      prosperity. It seemed to her that they reached very quickly the restaurant
      he had in view. With keen enjoyment of the novelty, she followed him
      between tables where people were eating, drinking, smoking, and took a
      place beside him on a cushioned seat at the end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;re tired,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nearly half-an-hour before you
      need move.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy hesitated in her choice of a refreshment. She wished to have
      something unusual, something that fitted an occasion so remarkable, yet,
      as Crewe would of course pay, she did not like to propose anything
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now let me choose for you,&rsquo; her companion requested. &lsquo;After all that
      rough work, you want something more than a drop of lemonade. I&rsquo;m going to
      order a nice little bottle of champagne out of the ice, and a pretty
      little sandwich made of whatever you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Champagne&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been in her thoughts, a sparkling audacity. Good; champagne let it
      be. And she leaned back in defiant satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect much from Jubilee Day,&rsquo; observed the man of business,
      &lsquo;but that only shows how things turn out&mdash;always better or worse than
      you think for. I&rsquo;m not likely to forget it; it&rsquo;s the best day I&rsquo;ve had in
      my life yet, and I leave you to guess who I owe <i>that</i> to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think this is good wine,&rsquo; remarked Nancy, as if she had not heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not bad. You wouldn&rsquo;t suppose a fellow of my sort would know anything
      about it. But I do. I&rsquo;ve drunk plenty of good champagne, and I shall drink
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy ate her sandwich and smiled. The one glass sufficed her; Crewe drank
      three. Presently, looking at her with his head propped on his hand, he
      said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whether this is the last walk we shall have together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can say?&rsquo; she answered in a light tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one ought to be able to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never make prophecies, and never believe other people&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shows your good sense. But <i>I</i> make wishes, and plenty of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let us both make a wish to ourselves,&rsquo; proposed Crewe, regarding her
      with eyes that had an uncommon light in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion laughed, then both were quiet for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They allowed themselves plenty of time to battle their way as far as
      Westminster Bridge. At one point police and crowd were in brief conflict;
      the burly guardians of order dealt thwacking blows, right and left, sound
      fisticuffs, backed with hearty oaths. The night was young; by magisterial
      providence, hours of steady drinking lay before the hardier jubilants.
      Thwacks and curses would be no rarity in another hour or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of Parliament Street, Nancy came face to face with Samuel
      Barmby, on whose arm hung the wearied Jessica. Without heeding their
      exclamations, she turned to her protector and bade him a hearty
      good-night. Crewe accepted his dismissal. He made survey of Barmby, and
      moved off singing to himself, &lsquo;<i>Do not forget me&mdash;do not forget me</i>&mdash;&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      The disorder which Stephen Lord masked as a &lsquo;touch of gout&rsquo; had in truth a
      much more disagreeable name. It was now twelve months since his doctor&rsquo;s
      first warning, directed against the savoury meats and ardent beverages
      which constituted his diet; Stephen resolved upon a change of habits, but
      the flesh held him in bondage, and medical prophecy was justified by the
      event. All through Jubilee Day he suffered acutely; for the rest of the
      week he remained at home, sometimes sitting in the garden, but generally
      keeping his room, where he lay on a couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of method and routine, sedentary, with a strong dislike of
      unfamiliar surroundings, he could not be persuaded to try change of air.
      The disease intensified his native stubbornness, made him by turns fretful
      and furious, disposed him to a sullen solitude. He would accept no
      tendance but that of Mary Woodruff; to her, as to his children, he kept up
      the pretence of gout. He was visited only by Samuel Barmby, with whom he
      discussed details of business, and by Mr. Barmby, senior, his friend of
      thirty years, the one man to whom he unbosomed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His effort to follow the regimen medically prescribed to him was even now
      futile. At the end of a week&rsquo;s time, imagining himself somewhat better, he
      resumed his daily walk to Camberwell Road, but remained at the warehouse
      only till two or three o&rsquo;clock, then returned and sat alone in his room.
      On one of the first days of July, when the weather was oppressively hot,
      he entered the house about noon, and in a few minutes rang his bell. Mary
      Woodruff came to him. He was sitting on the couch, pale, wet with
      perspiration, and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want something to drink,&rsquo; he said wearily, without raising his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have the lime-water, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;what you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary brought it to him, and he drank two large glasses, with no pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In town, sir. She said she would be back about four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an angry movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s she doing in town? She said nothing to me. Why doesn&rsquo;t she come
      back to lunch? Where does she go to for all these hours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant spoke in a low, respectful voice, looking at her master with
      eyes that seemed to compassionate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; He waved a hand, as if in dismissal. &lsquo;Wait&mdash;if
      I&rsquo;m to be alone, I might as well have lunch now. I feel hungry, as if I
      hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything for twenty-four hours. Get me something, Mary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the afternoon his bell again sounded, and Mary answered it. As he
      did not speak at once,&mdash;he was standing by the window with his hands
      behind him,&mdash;she asked him his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring me some water, Mary, plain drinking-water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned with a jug and glass, and he took a long draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t go yet. I want to&mdash;to talk to you about things. Sit down
      there for a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the couch, and Mary, with an anxious look, obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of leaving this house, and going to live in the country.
      There&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t. My partner can look after the business
      well enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might be the best thing you could do, sir. The best for your health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it might. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with things. I want to make a decided
      change, in every way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had grown more haggard during the last few days, and his eyes
      wandered, expressing fretfulness or fear; he spoke with effort, and seemed
      unable to find the words that would convey his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I want you to tell me plainly, what do you think of Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of her, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak in that way. I don&rsquo;t want you to call me &lsquo;sir&rsquo;;
      it isn&rsquo;t necessary; we&rsquo;ve known each other so long, and I think of you as
      a friend, a very good friend. Think of me in the same way, and speak
      naturally. I want to know your opinion of Nancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener had a face of grave attention: it signified no surprise, no
      vulgar self-consciousness, but perhaps a just perceptible pleasure. And in
      replying she looked steadily at her master for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t feel I can judge her, Mr. Lord. It&rsquo;s true, in a way, I
      ought to know her very well, as I&rsquo;ve seen her day by day since she was a
      little thing. But now she&rsquo;s a well-educated and clever young lady, and she
      has got far beyond me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, there it is, there it is!&rsquo; Stephen interrupted with bitterness.
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got beyond us&mdash;beyond me as well as you. And she isn&rsquo;t what I
      meant her to be, very far from it. I haven&rsquo;t brought them up as I wished.
      I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why. It was in own hands. When
      they were little children, I said to myself: hey shall grow up plain,
      good, honest girl and boy. I said that I wouldn&rsquo;t educate them very much;
      I saw little good that came of it, in our rank of life. I meant them to be
      simple-minded. I hoped Nancy would marry a plain countryman, like the men
      I used to know when I was a boy; a farmer, or something of that kind. But
      see how it&rsquo;s come about. It wasn&rsquo;t that I altered my mind about what was
      best. But I seemed to have no choice. For one thing, I made more money at
      business than I had expected, and so&mdash;and so it seemed that they
      ought to be educated above me and mine. There was my mother, did a better
      woman ever live? She had no education but that of home. She could have
      brought up Nancy in the good, old-fashioned way, if I had let her. I wish
      I had, yes, I wish I had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you could have felt satisfied,&rsquo; said the listener, with
      intelligent sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? If she had been as good and useful a woman as <i>you</i> are&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you mustn&rsquo;t think in that way, Mr. Lord. I was born and bred to
      service. Your daughter had a mind given her at her birth, that would never
      have been content with humble things. She was meant for education and a
      higher place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What higher place is there for her? She thinks herself too good for the
      life she leads here, and yet I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll ever find a place
      among people of a higher class. She has told me herself it&rsquo;s my fault. She
      says I ought to have had a big house for her, so that she might make
      friends among the rich. Perhaps she&rsquo;s right. I have made her neither one
      thing nor another. Mary, if I had never come to London, I might have lived
      happily. My place was away there, in the old home. I&rsquo;ve known that for
      many a year. I&rsquo;ve thought: wait till I&rsquo;ve made a little more money, and
      I&rsquo;ll go back. But it was never done; and now it looks to me as if I had
      spoilt the lives of my children, as well as my own. I can&rsquo;t trust Nancy,
      that&rsquo;s the worst of it. You don&rsquo;t know what she did on Jubilee night. She
      wasn&rsquo;t with Mr. Barmby and the others&mdash;Barmby told me about it; she
      pretended to lose them, and went off somewhere to meet a man she&rsquo;s never
      spoken to me about. Is that how a good girl would act? I didn&rsquo;t speak to
      her about it; what use? Very likely she wouldn&rsquo;t tell me the truth. She
      takes it for granted I can&rsquo;t understand her. She thinks her education puts
      her above all plain folk and their ways&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s eyes had fallen, and she kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose anything happened to me, and they were left to themselves. I have
      money to leave between them, and of course they know it. How could it do
      them anything but harm? Do you know that Horace wants to marry that girl
      Fanny French&mdash;a grinning, chattering fool&mdash;if not worse. He has
      told me he shall do as he likes. Whether or no it was right to educate
      Nancy, I am very sure that I ought to have done with <i>him</i> as I meant
      at first. He hasn&rsquo;t the brains to take a good position. When his schooling
      went on year after year, I thought at last to make of him something better
      than his father&mdash;a doctor, or a lawyer. But he hadn&rsquo;t the brains: he
      disappointed me bitterly. And what use can he make of my money, when I&rsquo;m
      in my grave? If I die soon he&rsquo;ll marry, and ruin his life. And won&rsquo;t it be
      the same with Nancy? Some plotting, greedy fellow&mdash;the kind of man
      you see everywhere now-a-days, will fool her for the money&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must hope they&rsquo;ll be much older and wiser before they have to act for
      themselves,&rsquo; said Mary, looking into her master&rsquo;s troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; He came nearer to her, with a sudden hopefulness. &lsquo;And whether I
      live much longer or not, I can do something to guard them against their
      folly. They needn&rsquo;t have the money as soon as I am gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in front of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to ask you something, Mary. If they were left alone, would you be
      willing to live here still, as you do now, for a few more years?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do whatever you wish&mdash;whatever you bid me, Mr. Lord,&rsquo; 
      answered the woman, in a voice of heartfelt loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would stay on, and keep house for them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But would they go on living here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could make them do so. I could put it down as a condition, in my will.
      At all events, I would make Nancy stay. Horace might live where he liked&mdash;though
      not with money to throw about. They have no relatives that could be of any
      use to them. I should wish Nancy to go on living here, and you with her;
      and she would only have just a sufficient income, paid by my old friend
      Barmby, or by his son. And that till she was&mdash;what? I have thought of
      six-and-twenty. By that time she would either have learnt wisdom, or she
      never would. She must be free sooner or later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she couldn&rsquo;t live by herself, Mr. Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell me you would stay,&rsquo; he exclaimed impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but I am only her servant. That wouldn&rsquo;t be enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be. Your position shall be changed. There&rsquo;s no one living to
      whom I could trust her as I could to you. There&rsquo;s no woman I respect so
      much. For twenty years you have proved yourself worthy of respect&mdash;and
      it shall be paid to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His vehemence would brook no opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said you would do as I wished. I wish you to have a new position in
      this house. You shall no longer be called a servant; you shall be our
      housekeeper, and our friend. I will have it, I tell you!&rsquo; he cried
      angrily. &lsquo;You shall sit at table with us, and live with us. Nancy still
      has sense enough to acknowledge that this is only your just reward; from
      her, I know, there won&rsquo;t be a word of objection. What can you have to say
      against it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was pale with emotion. Her reserve and sensibility shrank from
      what seemed to her an invidious honour, yet she durst not irritate the
      sick man by opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will make Nancy think,&rsquo; he pursued, with emphasis. &lsquo;It will help her,
      perhaps, to see the difference between worthless women who put themselves
      forward, and the women of real value who make no pretences. Perhaps it
      isn&rsquo;t too late to set good examples before her. I&rsquo;ve never found her
      ill-natured, though she&rsquo;s wilful; it isn&rsquo;t her heart that&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;I
      hope and think not&mdash;only her mind, that&rsquo;s got stuffed with foolish
      ideas. Since her grandmother&rsquo;s death she&rsquo;s had no guidance. You shall talk
      to her as a woman can; not all at once, but when she&rsquo;s used to thinking of
      you in this new way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are forgetting her friends,&rsquo; Mary said at length, with eyes of
      earnest appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her friends? She&rsquo;s better without such friends. There&rsquo;s one thing I used
      to hope, but I&rsquo;ve given it up. I thought once that she might have come to
      a liking for Samuel Barmby, but now I don&rsquo;t think she ever will, and I
      believe it&rsquo;s her friends that are to blame for it. One thing I know, that
      she&rsquo;ll never meet with any one who will make her so good a husband as he
      would. We don&rsquo;t think alike in every way; he&rsquo;s a young man, and has the
      new ideas; but I&rsquo;ve known him since he was a boy, and I respect his
      character. He has a conscience, which is no common thing now-a-days. He
      lives a clean, homely life&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t find many of his age who
      do. Nancy thinks herself a thousand times too good for him; I only hope he
      mayn&rsquo;t prove a great deal too good for <i>her</i>. But I&rsquo;ve given up that
      thought. I&rsquo;ve never spoken to her about it, and I never shall; no good
      comes of forcing a girl&rsquo;s inclination. I only tell you of it, Mary,
      because I want you to understand what has been going on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a bell ring; that of the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be Miss. Nancy,&rsquo; said Mary, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to the door then. If it&rsquo;s Nancy, tell her I want to speak to her, and
      come back yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Lord&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do as I tell you&mdash;at once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the latent force of Stephen&rsquo;s character now declared itself. He stood
      upright, his face stern and dignified. In a few moments, Nancy entered the
      room, and Mary followed her at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;I want to tell you of a change in the house.
      You know that Mary has been with us for twenty years. You know that for a
      long time we haven&rsquo;t thought of her as a servant, but as a friend, and one
      of the best possible. It&rsquo;s time now to show our gratitude. Mary will
      continue to help us as before, but henceforth she is one of our family.
      She will eat with us and sit with us; and I look to you, my girl, to make
      the change an easy and pleasant one for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she understood the drift of her father&rsquo;s speech, Nancy
      experienced a shock, and could not conceal it. But when silence came, she
      had commanded herself. An instant&rsquo;s pause; then, with her brightest smile,
      she turned to Mary and spoke in a voice of kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father is quite right. Your place is with us. I am glad, very glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked from Mr. Lord to his daughter, tried vainly to speak, and left
      the room.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s contemptuous wrath had an ill effect upon Horace. Of an
      amiable disposition, and without independence of character, he might have
      been guided by a judicious parent through all the perils of his calf-love
      for Fanny French; thrown upon his own feeble resources, he regarded
      himself as a victim of the traditional struggle between prosaic age and
      nobly passionate youth, and resolved at all hazards to follow the heroic
      course&mdash;which meant, first of all, a cold taciturnity towards his
      father, and, as to his future conduct, a total disregard of the domestic
      restraints which he had hitherto accepted. In a day or two he sat down and
      wrote his father a long letter, of small merit as a composition, and
      otherwise illustrating the profitless nature of the education for which
      Stephen Lord had hopefully paid. It began with a declaration of rights. He
      was a man; he could no longer submit to childish trammels. A man must not
      be put to inconvenience by the necessity of coming home at early hours. A
      man could not brook cross-examination on the subject of his intimacies,
      his expenditure, and so forth. Above all, a man was answerable to no one
      but himself for his relations with the other sex, for the sacred hopes he
      cherished, for his emotions and aspirations which transcended even a man&rsquo;s
      vocabulary.&mdash;With much more of like tenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this epistle, delivered by post, Mr. Lord made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace flattered himself that he had gained a victory. There was nothing
      like &lsquo;firmness,&rsquo; and that evening, about nine, he went to De Crespigny
      Park. As usual, he had to ring the bell two or three times before any one
      came; the lively notes of a piano sounded from the drawing-room,
      intimating, no doubt, that Mrs. Peachey had guests. The door at length
      opened, and he bade the servant let Miss. Fanny know that he was here; he
      would wait in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet dark, but objects could only just be distinguished; the
      gloom supplied Horace with a suggestion at which he laughed to himself. He
      had laid down his hat and cane, when a voice surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked some one from the back of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, are <i>you</i> there, Mr. Peachey?&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come to see Fanny. I
      didn&rsquo;t care to go among the people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. We&rsquo;d better light the gas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With annoyance, Horace saw the master of the house come forward, and
      strike a match. Remains of dinner were still on the table. The two
      exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is your father?&rsquo; Peachey inquired. He had a dull, depressed look, and
      moved languidly to draw down the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he isn&rsquo;t quite up to the mark. But it&rsquo;s nothing serious, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord quite well?&mdash;We haven&rsquo;t seen much of her lately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, I&rsquo;m sure.&mdash;Nobody can depend upon her very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave you,&rsquo; said the other, with a dreary look about the room.
      &lsquo;The table ought to have been cleared by now&mdash;but that&rsquo;s nothing
      new.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confounded servants,&rsquo; muttered Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, the servants,&rsquo; was Peachey&rsquo;s ironical reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was left alone, Horace turned out the gas. Then he stood
      near the door, trembling with amorous anticipation. But minutes went by;
      his impatience grew intolerable; he stamped, and twisted his fingers
      together. Then of a sudden the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s dark, there&rsquo;s nobody here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny discovered her mistake. She was seized and lifted off her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Do you want to eat me? I&rsquo;ll hit you as hard as I can, I will! You&rsquo;re
      spoiling my dress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last remonstrance was in a note that Horace did not venture to
      disregard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strike a light, silly! I know you&rsquo;ve done something to my dress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace pleaded abjectly to be forgiven, and that the room might remain
      shadowed; but Fanny was disturbed in temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t light the gas, I&rsquo;ll go at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t any matches, darling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, just like you! You never have anything. I thought every man carried
      matches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke from him, and ran out. Wretched in the fear that she might not
      return, Horace waited on the threshold. In the drawing-room some one was
      singing &lsquo;The Maid of the Mill.&rsquo; It came to an end, and there sounded
      voices, which the tormented listener strove to recognise. For at least ten
      minutes he waited, and was all but frantic, when the girl made her
      appearance, coming downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never do that again,&rsquo; she said viciously. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had to unfasten my
      things, and put them straight. What a nuisance you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood cowed before her, limp and tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, light the gas. Why couldn&rsquo;t you come into the drawing-room, like
      other people do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; asked the young man, when he had obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go and see for yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Fanny.&rsquo; He followed her, like a dog, as she walked round
      the table to look at herself in the mirror over the fireplace. &lsquo;It was
      only because I&rsquo;m so fond of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what a silly you are!&rsquo; she laughed, seating herself on the arm of an
      easy-chair. &lsquo;Go ahead! What&rsquo;s the latest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, for one thing, I&rsquo;ve had a very clear understanding with the gov&rsquo;nor
      about my independence. I showed him that I meant having my own way, and he
      might bully as much as he liked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not thus that Horace would naturally have spoken, not thus that he
      thought of his father. Fanny had subdued him to her own level, poisoned
      him with the desires excited by her presence. And he knew his baseness; he
      was not ignorant of the girl&rsquo;s ignoble nature. Only the fury of a virgin
      passion enabled him to talk, and sometimes think, as though he were in
      love with ideal purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you had the pluck,&rsquo; said Fanny, swinging one of her feet
      as she tittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shows you haven&rsquo;t done me justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re going to stay out late at night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As late as I like,&rsquo; Horace answered, crossing his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then where will you take me to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Horace was in funds just now; he had received his
      quarter&rsquo;s salary. Board and lodging were no expense to him; he provided
      his own clothing, but, with this exception, had to meet no serious claim.
      So, in reply to Fanny&rsquo;s characteristic question, he jingled coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wherever you like.&mdash;&ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ruddigore&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted with his assent, she became more gracious, permitted a modest
      caress, and presently allowed herself to be drawn on to her lover&rsquo;s knee.
      She was passive, unconcerned; no second year graduate of the pavement
      could have preserved a completer equanimity; it did not appear that her
      pulse quickened ever so slightly, nor had her eyelid the suspicion of a
      droop. She hummed &lsquo;Queen of my Heart,&rsquo; and grew absent in speculative
      thought, whilst Horace burned and panted at the proximity of her white
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how I do love you, Fanny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She trod playfully on his toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t told the old gentleman yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking about it. But, Fanny, suppose he was to&mdash;to
      refuse to do anything for us. Would it make any difference? There are lots
      of people who marry on a hundred and fifty a year&mdash;oh lots!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The maiden arched her brows, and puckered her lips. Hitherto it had been
      taken for granted that Mr. Lord would be ready with subsidy; Horace, in a
      large, vague way, had hinted that assurance long ago. Fanny&rsquo;s
      disinclination to plight her troth&mdash;she still deemed herself
      absolutely free&mdash;had alone interfered between the young man and a
      definite project of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of people?&rsquo; she asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;respectable, educated people, like ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And live in apartments? Thank you; I don&rsquo;t quite see myself. There isn&rsquo;t
      a bit of hurry, dear boy. Wait a bit.&rsquo; She began to sing &lsquo;Wait till the
      clouds roll by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you thought as much of me as I do of you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of her position, Fanny jumped up and took a spoonful of sweet jelly
      from a dish on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have some?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here again. I&rsquo;ve something more to tell you. Something very
      important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could only be prevailed upon to take a seat near him. Horace, beset
      with doubts as to his prudence, but unable to keep the secret, began to
      recount the story of his meeting with Mrs. Damerel, whom he had now seen
      for the second time. Fanny&rsquo;s curiosity, instantly awakened, grew eager as
      he proceeded. She questioned with skill and pertinacity, and elicited many
      more details than Nancy Lord had been able to gather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll promise me not to say a word to any one?&rsquo; pleaded Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t open my lips. But you&rsquo;re quite sure she&rsquo;s as old as you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old enough to be my mother, I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s suspicions were not wholly set at rest, but she made no further
      display of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now just think what an advantage it might be to you, to know her,&rsquo; Horace
      pursued. &lsquo;She&rsquo;d introduce you at once to fashionable society, really
      tip-top people. How would you like that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not bad,&rsquo; was the judicial reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must have no end of money, and who knows what she might do for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly queer thing,&rsquo; mused the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no denying that. We must keep it close, whatever we do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t told anybody else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a soul!&rsquo; Horace lied stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were surprised by the sudden opening of the door; a servant appeared
      to clear the table. Fanny reprimanded her for neglecting to knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may as well go into the drawing-room. There&rsquo;s nobody particular. Only
      Mrs. Middlemist, and Mr. Crewe, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall they encountered Crewe himself, who stood there conversing
      with Beatrice. A few words were exchanged by the two men, and Horace
      followed his enchantress into the drawing-room, where he found, seated in
      conversation with Mrs. Peachey, two persons whom he had occasionally met
      here. One of them, Mrs. Middlemist, was a stout, coarse, high-coloured
      woman, with fingers much bejewelled. Until a year or two ago she had
      adorned the private bar of a public-house kept by her husband; retired
      from this honourable post, she now devoted herself to society and the
      domestic virtues. The other guest, Mrs. Murch by name, proclaimed herself,
      at a glance, of less prosperous condition, though no less sumptuously
      arrayed. Her face had a hungry, spiteful, leering expression; she spoke in
      a shrill, peevish tone, and wriggled nervously on her chair. In eleven
      years of married life, Mrs. Murch had borne six children, all of whom died
      before they were six months old. She lived apart from her husband, who had
      something to do with the manufacture of an Infants&rsquo; Food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was requested to sing. She sat down at the piano, rattled a prelude,
      and gave forth an echo of the music-halls:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>It&rsquo;s all up with poor Tommy now. I shall never more be happy, I vow.
      It&rsquo;s just a week to-day Since my Sairey went away, And it&rsquo;s all up with
      poor Tommy now</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Middlemist, who prided herself upon serious vocal powers, remarked
      that comic singing should be confined to men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t a bad voice, my dear, if you would only take pains with it.
      Now sing us &ldquo;For Ever and for Ever.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This song being the speaker&rsquo;s peculiar glory, she was of course requested
      to sing it herself, and, after entreaty, consented. Her eyes turned
      upward, her fat figure rolling from side to side, her mouth very wide
      open, Mrs. Middlemist did full justice to the erotic passion of this great
      lyric:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Perchawnce if we &lsquo;ad never met, We &lsquo;ad been spared this mad regret,
      This hendless striving to forget&mdash;For hever&mdash;hand&mdash;for
      he-e-e-ver!</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Murch let her head droop sentimentally. Horace glanced at Fanny, who,
      however, seemed absorbed in reflections as unsentimental as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, on a garden seat under the calm but misty sky, sat
      Luckworth Crewe and Beatrice French. Crewe smoked a cigar placidly;
      Beatrice was laying before him the suggestion of her great commercial
      scheme, already confided to Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does it strike you?&rsquo; she asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not bad, old chap. There&rsquo;s something in it, if you&rsquo;re clever enough to
      carry it through. And I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you are.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you help to
      set it going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help with money,&rsquo; Crewe replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; will you help in other ways? Practical hints, and so on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I will. Always ready to encourage merit in the money-making
      line. What capital are you prepared to put into it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much. The public must supply the capital.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sound principle,&rsquo; Crewe laughed. &lsquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t go on the old lines.
      You didn&rsquo;t think of starting a limited company? You&rsquo;d find difficulties.
      Now what you want to start is a&mdash;let us call it the South London
      Dress Supply Association, or something of that kind. But you won&rsquo;t get to
      that all at once. You ought to have premises to begin with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m aware of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you raise a thousand or so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I could&mdash;if I chose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, look here. Your notion of the Fashion Club is a deuced good one, and
      I don&rsquo;t see why it shouldn&rsquo;t be pretty easily started. Out of every five
      hundred women, you can reckon on four hundred and ninety-nine being fools;
      and there isn&rsquo;t a female fool who wouldn&rsquo;t read and think about a circular
      which promised her fashionable dresses for an unfashionable price. That&rsquo;s
      a great and sound basis to start on. What I advise is, that you should
      first of all advertise for a dress-making concern that would admit a
      partner with a small capital. You&rsquo;ll have between ten and twelve hundred
      replies, but don&rsquo;t be staggered; go through them carefully, and select a
      shop that&rsquo;s well situated, and doing a respectable trade. Get hold of
      these people, and induce them to make changes in their business to suit
      your idea. Then blaze away with circulars, headed &ldquo;South London Fashion
      Club;&rdquo; send them round the whole district, addressed to women. Every idiot
      of them will, at all events, come and look at the shop; that can be
      depended upon; in itself no bad advertisement. Arrange to have a special
      department&mdash;special entrance, if possible&mdash;with &ldquo;The Club&rdquo;
       painted up. Yes, by jingo! Have a big room, with comfortable chairs, and
      the women&rsquo;s weekly papers lying about, and smart dresses displayed on
      what-d&rsquo;ye-call-&rsquo;ems, like they have in windows. Make the subscription very
      low at first, and give rattling good value; never mind if you lose by it.
      Then, when you&rsquo;ve got hold of a lot of likely people, try them with the
      share project. By-the-bye, if you lose no time, you can bring in the
      Jubilee somehow. Yes, start with the &ldquo;Jubilee Fashion Club.&rdquo; I wonder
      nobody&rsquo;s done it already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice was growing elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The public has to wait for its benefactors,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, would you like me to sketch you out a prospectus of
      the Club?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you might do that if you like. You won&rsquo;t expect to be paid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang it! what do you take me for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Business is business,&rsquo; Miss. French remarked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is. And friendship is friendship. Got a match?&rsquo; He laughed. &lsquo;No, I
      suppose you haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get you one if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good fellow. I&rsquo;ll think in the meantime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice rose lazily, and was absent for several minutes. When she
      returned, Crewe re-lit his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I start the shop on my own account?&rsquo; Beatrice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t capital enough. A little place wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I can get Fanny to join me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you? What will young Lord have to say to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Psh! That&rsquo;s all fooling. It&rsquo;ll never come to anything. Unless, of course,
      the old man turned up his toes, and left the boy a tidy sum. But he won&rsquo;t
      just yet. I&rsquo;ve told Fanny that if she&rsquo;ll raise something on her houses,
      I&rsquo;ll guarantee her the same income she has now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take my advice,&rsquo; said Crewe weightily, &lsquo;and hook on to an established
      business. Of course, you can change the name if you like; and there&rsquo;d have
      to be alterations, and painting up, to give a new look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s risky, dealing with strangers. How if they got hold of my idea, and
      then refused to take me in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well now, look here. After all, I&rsquo;ll make a bargain with you, old chap.
      If I can introduce you to the right people, and get you safely started,
      will you give me all your advertising, on the usual commission?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean, give it to Bullock and Freeman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a secret just yet, but I&rsquo;m going to start for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice was silent. They exchanged a look in the gloom, and Crewe nodded,
      in confirmation of his announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much have you got?&rsquo; Miss. French inquired carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much. Most of the capital is here.&rsquo; He touched his forehead. &lsquo;Same as
      with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman glanced at him again, and said in a lower voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d have had more by now, if&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe waited, puffing his cigar, but she did not finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; he replied impartially. &lsquo;Maybe not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; Beatrice hastened to add. &lsquo;It was an idea, like
      any other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not half a bad idea. But there were obstacles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, Beatrice inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you still think the same about women with money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the same,&rsquo; Crewe replied at once, though with less than his usual
      directness; the question seemed to make him meditative. &lsquo;Just the same.
      Every man looks at it in his own way, of course. I&rsquo;m not the sort of chap
      to knuckle under to my wife; and there isn&rsquo;t one woman in a thousand, if
      she gave her husband a start, could help reminding him of it. It&rsquo;s the
      wrong way about. Let women be as independent as they like as long as
      they&rsquo;re not married. I never think the worse of them, whatever they do
      that&rsquo;s honest. But a wife must play second fiddle, and think her husband a
      small god almighty&mdash;that&rsquo;s my way of looking at the question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. We shall see.&mdash;When do you start business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This side Christmas. End of September, perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think to snatch a good deal from B. &amp; F., I daresay?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe nodded and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ll look after this affair for me?&rsquo; said Beatrice, with a return
      to the tone of strict business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without loss of time. You shall be advised of progress. Of course I must
      debit you with exes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Mind you charge for all the penny stamps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one&mdash;don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, tilted forward on his toes, and stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be trotting homewards. It&rsquo;ll be time for by-by when I get to

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nancy was undisturbed by the promotion of Mary Woodruff. A short time ago
      it would have offended her; she would have thought her dignity, her social
      prospects, imperilled. She was now careless on that score, and felt it a
      relief to cast off the show of domestic authority. Henceforth her position
      would be like that of Horace. All she now desired was perfect freedom from
      responsibility,&mdash;to be, as it were, a mere lodger in the house, to
      come and go unquestioned and unrestrained by duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, by aid of circumstance, had she put herself into complete accord
      with the spirit of her time. Abundant privilege; no obligation. A
      reference of all things to her sovereign will and pleasure. Withal, a
      defiant rather than a hopeful mood; resentment of the undisguisable fact
      that her will was sovereign only in a poor little sphere which she would
      gladly have transcended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now-a-days she never went in the direction of Champion Hill, formerly her
      favourite walk. If Jessica Morgan spoke of her acquaintances there, she
      turned abruptly to another subject. She thought of the place as an abode
      of arrogance and snobbery. She recalled with malicious satisfaction her
      ill-mannered remark to Lionel Tarrant. Let him think of her as he would;
      at all events he could no longer imagine her overawed by his social
      prestige. The probability was that she had hurt him in a sensitive spot;
      it might be hoped that the wound would rankle for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her personal demeanour showed a change. So careful hitherto of feminine
      grace and decorum, she began to affect a mannishness of bearing, a
      bluntness of speech, such as found favour at De Crespigny Park. In a few
      weeks she had resumed friendly intercourse with Mrs. Peachey and her
      sisters, and spent an occasional evening at their house. Her father asked
      no questions; she rarely saw him except at meals. A stranger must have
      observed the signs of progressive malady in Mr. Lord&rsquo;s face, but Nancy was
      aware of nothing to cause uneasiness; she thought of him as suffering a
      little from &lsquo;gout;&rsquo; elderly people were of course subject to such
      disorders. On most days he went to business; if he remained at home, Mary
      attended him assiduously, and he would accept no other ministration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was no longer inclined to study, and cared little for reading of any
      sort. That new book on Evolution, which she had brought from the library
      just before Jubilee Day, was still lying about; a dozen times she had
      looked at it with impatience, and reminded herself that it must be
      returned. Evolution! She already knew all about Darwinism, all she needed
      to know. If necessary she could talk about it&mdash;oh, with an air. But
      who wanted to talk about such things? After all, only priggish people,&mdash;the
      kind of people who lived at Champion Hill. Or idiots like Samuel Bennett
      Barmby, who bothered about the future of the world. What was it to <i>her</i>&mdash;the
      future of the world? She wanted to live in the present, to enjoy her
      youth. An evening like that she had spent in the huge crowd, with a man
      like Crewe to amuse her with his talk, was worth whole oceans of
      &lsquo;culture.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Culture&rsquo; she already possessed, abundance of it. The heap of books she
      had read! Last winter she had attended a course of lectures, delivered by
      &lsquo;a young University gentleman with a tone of bland omniscience, on &lsquo;The
      History of Hellenic Civilisation;&rsquo; her written answers to the little &lsquo;test
      papers&rsquo; had been marked &lsquo;very satisfactory.&rsquo; Was it not a proof of culture
      achieved? Education must not encroach upon the years of maturity. Nature
      marked the time when a woman should begin to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was poor Jessica. As July drew on, Jessica began to look cadaverous,
      ghostly. She would assuredly break down long before the time of her
      examination. What a wretched, what an absurd existence! Her home, too, was
      so miserable. Mrs. Morgan lay ill, unable to attend to anything; if she
      could not have a change of air, it must soon be all over with her. But
      they had no money, no chance of going to the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened at length that Mr. Lord saw Jessica one evening, when she had
      come to spend an hour in Grove Lane. After her departure, he asked Nancy
      what was the matter with the girl, and Nancy explained the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, why not take her with you, when you go away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that I was going away, father. Nothing has been said of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your own business. I leave you to make what plans you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You</i> ought to have a change,&rsquo; she said considerately. &lsquo;It would do
      you good. Suppose we all go to Teignmouth? I should think that would suit
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why Teignmouth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I enjoyed it last year. And the lodgings were comfortable. We could have
      the same, from the first week in August.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wrote the other day, and asked,&rsquo; Nancy replied with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Lord declined to leave home. Mary Woodruff did her best to
      persuade him, until he angrily imposed silence. In a day or two he said to
      Nancy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you wish to go to Teignmouth, take Jessica and her mother. People
      mustn&rsquo;t die for want of a five-pound note. Make your arrangements, and let
      me know what money you&rsquo;ll need.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lord turned away. His daughter noticed that he walked feebly, and she
      felt a moment&rsquo;s compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father&mdash;you are not so well to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking round, he replied that he would be well enough if left
      alone; and Nancy did not venture to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, she called in De Crespigny Park after dinnertime. Mrs.
      Peachey and Fanny were at Brighton; Beatrice had preferred to stay in
      London, being very busy with her great project. Whilst she talked of it
      with Nancy, Peachey and Luckworth Crewe came in together. There was
      sprightly conversation, in which the host, obviously glad of his wife&rsquo;s
      absence, took a moderate part. Presently, Miss. Lord and he found
      themselves gossiping alone; the other two had moved aside, and, as a look
      informed Nancy, were deep in confidential dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of that business?&rsquo; she asked her companion in an
      undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it answers,&rsquo; said the young man, speaking as usual,
      with a soft, amiable voice. &lsquo;Our friend is helping, and he generally knows
      what he&rsquo;s about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe remained only for half-an-hour; on shaking hands with him, Nancy
      made known that she was going to the seaside next Monday for a few weeks,
      and the man of business answered only with &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy yourself.&rsquo; 
      Soon afterwards, she took leave. At the junction of De Crespigny Park and
      Grove Lane, some one approached her, and with no great surprise Nancy saw
      that it was Crewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been waiting for you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You remember you promised me another
      walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s much too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is. I didn&rsquo;t mean now. But to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible.&rsquo; She moved on, in the direction away from her home. &lsquo;I shall
      be with friends in the evening, the Morgans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confound it! I had made up my mind to ask you for last Saturday, but some
      country people nabbed me for the whole of that day. I took them up the
      Monument, and up St Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never been up the Monument,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never? Come to-morrow afternoon then. You can spare the afternoon. Let&rsquo;s
      meet early somewhere. Take a bus to London Bridge. I&rsquo;ll be at the north
      end of London Bridge at three o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll be there,&rsquo; Nancy replied off-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You really will? Three, sharp. I was never late at an appointment,
      business or pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which do you consider this?&rsquo; asked his companion, with a shrewd glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s unkind. I came here to-night on business, though. You quite
      understand that, didn&rsquo;t you? I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to make any mistake.
      Business, pure and simple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course,&rsquo; replied Nancy, with an ingenuous air. &lsquo;What else could
      it be?&rsquo; And she added, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come any further. Ta-ta!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe went off into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon, Nancy alighted at London Bridge a full quarter of an
      hour late. It had been raining at intervals through the day, and clouds
      still cast a gloom over the wet streets. Crewe, quite insensible to
      atmospheric influence, came forward with his wonted brisk step and
      animated visage. At Miss. Lord&rsquo;s side he looked rather more plebeian than
      when walking by himself; his high-hat, not of the newest, utterly
      misbecame his head, and was always at an unconventional angle, generally
      tilting back; his clothes, of no fashionable cut, bore the traces of
      perpetual hurry and multifarious impact. But he carried a perfectly new
      and expensive umbrella, to which, as soon as he had shaken hands with her,
      he drew Nancy&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A present this morning, from a friend of mine in the business. I ran into
      his shop to get shelter. Upon my word, I had no intention; didn&rsquo;t think
      anything about it. However, he owed me an acknowledgment; I&rsquo;ve sent him
      three customers from our office since I saw him last. By-the-bye, I shall
      have half a day at the seaside on Monday. There&rsquo;s a sale of building-plots
      down at Whitsand. The estate agents run a complimentary special train for
      people going down to bid, and give a lunch before the auction begins. Not
      bad business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are <i>you</i> going to bid?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a look, at all events; and if I see anything that takes
      my fancy&mdash;. Ever been to Whitsand? I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s a growing place. I
      should like to get hold of a few advertising stations.&mdash;Where is it
      you are going to on Monday? Teignmouth? I don&rsquo;t know that part of the
      country. Wish I could run down, but I shan&rsquo;t have time. I&rsquo;ve got my work
      cut out for August and September. Would you like to come and see the place
      where I think of opening shop?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it far?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. We&rsquo;ll walk round when we&rsquo;ve been up the Monument. You don&rsquo;t often go
      about the City, I daresay. Nothing doing, of course, on a Saturday
      afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy made him moderate his pace, which was too quick for her. Part of the
      pleasure she found in Crewe&rsquo;s society came from her sense of being so
      undeniably his superior; she liked to give him a sharp command, and
      observe his ready obedience. To his talk she listened with a good-natured,
      condescending smile, occasionally making a remark which implied a more
      liberal view, a larger intelligence, than his. Thus, as they stood for a
      moment to look down at the steamboat wharf, and Crewe made some remark
      about the value of a cargo just being discharged, she said carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s the view you take of everything? You rate everything at
      market price.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marketable things, of course. But you know me well enough to understand
      that I&rsquo;m not always thinking of the shop. Wait till I&rsquo;ve made money.&mdash;Now
      then, clumsy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, leaning over the parapet by Nancy&rsquo;s side, had pushed against her.
      Thus addressed he glared at the speaker, but encountered a bellicose look
      which kept him quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall live in a big way,&rsquo; Crewe continued, as they walked on towards
      Fish Street Hill. &lsquo;Not for the swagger of it; I don&rsquo;t care about that, but
      because I&rsquo;ve a taste for luxury. I shall have a country house, and keep
      good horses. And I should like to have a little farm of my own, a model
      farm; make my own butter and cheese, and know that I ate the real thing. I
      shall buy pictures. Haven&rsquo;t I told you I like pictures? Oh yes. I shall go
      round among the artists, and encourage talent that hasn&rsquo;t made itself
      known.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you recognise it?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I shall learn to. And I shall have my wife&rsquo;s portrait painted by
      some first-rate chap, never mind what it costs, and hung in the Academy.
      That&rsquo;s a great idea of mine&mdash;to see my wife&rsquo;s portrait in the
      Academy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, then, that your wife is ornamental.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take precious good care of that!&rsquo; Crewe exclaimed merrily. &lsquo;Do you
      suppose I should dream of marrying a woman who wasn&rsquo;t good-looking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shout, please. People can hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon.&rsquo; His voice sank to humility. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a bad habit of
      mine. But I was going to say&mdash;I went to the Academy this year just to
      look at the portraits of men&rsquo;s wives. There was nothing particular in that
      line. Not a woman I should have felt particularly proud of. Tastes differ,
      of course. Mine has altered a good deal in the last ten years. A man can&rsquo;t
      trust himself about women till he&rsquo;s thirty or near it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk of something else,&rsquo; Nancy commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly. There&rsquo;s the sun coming out. You see, I was afraid it would
      keep on raining, and you would have an excuse for staying at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I needed no excuse,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t wished to come, you may be
      sure I should have said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe flashed a look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s how I like to hear you speak! That does one good. Well, here
      we are. People used to be fond of going up, they say, just to pitch
      themselves down. A good deal of needless trouble, it seems to me. Perhaps
      they gave themselves the off-chance of changing their minds before they
      got to the top.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or wanted to see if life looked any better from up there,&rsquo; suggested
      Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or hoped somebody would catch them by the coat-tails, and settle a
      pension on them out of pity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus jesting, they began the ascent. Crewe, whose spirits were at high
      pressure, talked all the way up the winding stairs; on issuing into
      daylight, he became silent, and they stood side by side, mute before the
      vision of London&rsquo;s immensity. Nancy began to move round the platform. The
      strong west wind lashed her cheeks to a glowing colour; excitement added
      brilliancy to her eyes. As soon as she had recovered from the first
      impression, this spectacle of a world&rsquo;s wonder served only to exhilarate
      her; she was not awed by what she looked upon. In her conceit of
      self-importance, she stood there, above the battling millions of men,
      proof against mystery and dread, untouched by the voices of the past, and
      in the present seeing only common things, though from an odd point of
      view. Here her senses seemed to make literal the assumption by which her
      mind had always been directed: that she&mdash;Nancy Lord&mdash;was the mid
      point of the universe. No humility awoke in her; she felt the stirring of
      envies, avidities, unavowable passions, and let them flourish unrebuked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe had his eyes fixed upon her; his lips parted hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now <i>that&rsquo;s</i> how I should like to see you painted,&rsquo; he said all at
      once. &lsquo;Just like that! I never saw you looking so well. I believe you&rsquo;re
      the most beautiful girl to be found anywhere in this London!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was genuine emotion in his voice, and his sweeping gesture suited
      the mood of vehemence. Nancy, having seen that the two or three other
      people on the platform were not within hearing, gave an answer of which
      the frankness surprised even herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Portraits for the Academy cost a great deal, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working for. There are not many men down
      yonder,&rsquo; he pointed over the City, &lsquo;have a better head for money-making
      than I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, prove it,&rsquo; replied Nancy, and laughed as the wind caught her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long will you give me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but walked to the side whence she could look westward.
      Crewe followed close, his features still set in the hungry look, his eyes
      never moving from her warm cheek and full lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What it must be,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;to have about twenty thousand a year!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of business gave a gasp. In the same moment he had to clutch at
      his hat, lest it should be blown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty thousand a year?&rsquo; he echoed. &lsquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t impossible. Men get
      beyond that, and a good deal beyond it. But it&rsquo;s a large order.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is. But what was it you said? The most beautiful girl in all
      London? That&rsquo;s a large order, too, isn&rsquo;t it? How much is she worth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re talking for the joke now,&rsquo; said Crewe. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear that
      kind of thing, either. You never think in that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My thoughts are my own. I may think as I choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. But you have thoughts above money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I? How kind of you to say so.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this wind;
      we&rsquo;ll go down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way, and neither of them spoke till they were in the street
      again. Nancy felt her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I blown to pieces?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; you&rsquo;re all right. Now, will you walk through the City?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the place you spoke of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farringdon Street. That&rsquo;ll bring you round to Blackfriars Bridge, when
      you want to go home. But there&rsquo;s plenty of time yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they rambled aimlessly by the great thoroughfares, and by hidden
      streets of which Nancy had never heard, talking or silent as the mood
      dictated. Crewe had stories to tell of this and that thriving firm, of
      others struggling in obscurity or falling from high estate; to him the
      streets of London were so many chapters of romance, but a romance always
      of to-day, for he neither knew nor cared about historic associations. Vast
      sums sounded perpetually on his lips; he glowed with envious delight in
      telling of speculations that had built up great fortunes. He knew the
      fabulous rents that were paid for sites that looked insignificant; he
      repeated anecdotes of calls made from Somerset House upon men of business,
      who had been too modest in returning the statement of their income; he
      revived legends of dire financial disaster, and of catastrophe barely
      averted by strange expedients. To all this Nancy listened with only
      moderate interest; as often as not, she failed to understand the details
      which should have excited her wonder. None the less, she received an
      impression of knowledge, acuteness, power, in the speaker; and this was
      decidedly pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the place where I think of starting for myself,&rsquo; said Crewe, as he
      paused at length before a huge building in Farringdon Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This?&mdash;Can you afford such a rent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion burst into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the whole building. Two or three rooms, that&rsquo;s all,
      somewhere upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy made a jest of her mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An advertising agent doesn&rsquo;t want much space,&rsquo; said Crewe. &lsquo;I know a chap
      who&rsquo;s doing a pretty big business in one room, not far from here.&mdash;Well,
      we&rsquo;ve had a long walk; now you must rest a bit, and have a cup of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were going to propose champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;if you like&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to a restaurant in Fleet Street, and sat for half an hour over
      the milder beverage. Crewe talked of his projects, his prospects; and
      Nancy, whom the afternoon had in truth fatigued a little, though her mind
      was still excited, listened without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said at length, leaning towards her, &lsquo;how long do you give me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away, and kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two years:&mdash;just to make a solid start; to show that something worth
      talking &lsquo;about is to come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his position, and gazed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t money that would tempt you.&rsquo; He spoke in a very low
      voice, though no one was within earshot. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think I make any mistake
      about <i>that</i>! But I have to show you that there&rsquo;s something in me. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t marry any woman that thought I made love to her out of interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy began to draw on her gloves, and smiled, just biting her lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you give me a couple of years, from to-day? I won&rsquo;t bother you. It&rsquo;s
      honour bright!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rsquo; Nancy repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whilst you&rsquo;re away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, whilst I&rsquo;m away at Teignmouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And tell me when you come back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell you&mdash;how long. Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she rose.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the mouth of Exe to the mouth of Teign the coast is uninteresting.
      Such beauty as it once possessed has been destroyed by the railway. Cliffs
      of red sandstone drop to the narrow beach, warm between the blue of sky
      and sea, but without grandeur, and robbed of their native grace by
      navvy-hewing, which for the most part makes of them a mere embankment:
      their verdure stripped away, their juttings tunnelled, along their base
      the steel parallels of smoky traffic. Dawlish and Teignmouth have in
      themselves no charm; hotel and lodging-house, shamed by the soft pure
      light that falls about them, look blankly seaward, hiding what remains of
      farm or cottage in the older parts. Ebb-tide uncovers no fair stretch of
      sand, and at flood the breakers are thwarted on a bulwark of piled stone,
      which supports the railway, or protects a promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      But inland these discontents are soon forgotten; there amid tilth and
      pasture, gentle hills and leafy hollows of rural Devon, the eye rests and
      the mind is soothed. By lanes innumerable, deep between banks of fern and
      flower; by paths along the bramble-edge of scented meadows; by the secret
      windings of copse and brake and stream-worn valley&mdash;a way lies upward
      to the long ridge of Haldon, where breezes sing among the pines, or sweep
      rustling through gorse and bracken. Mile after mile of rustic loveliness,
      ever and anon the sea-limits blue beyond grassy slopes. White farms dozing
      beneath their thatch in harvest sunshine; hamlets forsaken save by women
      and children, by dogs and cats and poultry, the labourers afield. Here
      grow the tall foxgloves, bending a purple head in the heat of noon; here
      the great bells of the convolvulus hang thick from lofty hedges, massing
      their pink and white against dark green leafage; here amid shadowed
      undergrowth trail the long fronds of lustrous hartstongue; wherever the
      eye falls, profusion of summer&rsquo;s glory. Here, in many a nook carpeted with
      softest turf, canopied with tangle of leaf and bloom, solitude is safe
      from all intrusion&mdash;unless it be that of flitting bird, or of some
      timid wild thing that rustles for a moment and is gone. From dawn to
      midnight, as from midnight to dawn, one who would be alone with nature
      might count upon the security of these bosks and dells.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Nancy Lord and her companions such pleasures were unregarded. For the
      first few days after their arrival at Teignmouth, they sat or walked on
      the promenade, walked or sat on the pier, sat or walked on the Den&mdash;a
      long, wide lawn, decked about with shrubs and flower-beds, between
      sea-fronting houses and the beach. Nancy had no wish to exert herself, for
      the weather was hot; after her morning bathe with Jessica, she found
      amusement enough in watching the people&mdash;most of whom were here
      simply to look at each other, or in listening to the band, which played
      selections from Sullivan varied with dance music, or in reading a novel
      from the book-lender&rsquo;s,&mdash;that is to say, gazing idly at the page, and
      letting such significance as it possessed float upon her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pleasantly conscious that the loungers who passed by, male and
      female, gave something of attention to her face and costume. Without
      attempting to rival the masterpieces of fashion which invited envy or
      wonder from all observers, she thought herself nicely dressed, and had in
      fact, as always, made good use of her father&rsquo;s liberality. Her taste in
      garments had a certain timidity that served her well; by avoiding the
      extremes of mode, and in virtue of her admirable figure, she took the eye
      of those who looked for refinement rather than for extravagance. The
      unconsidered grace of her bearing might be recognised by all whom such
      things concerned; it by no means suggested that she came from a small
      house in Camberwell. In her companions, to be sure, she was unfortunate;
      but the over-modest attire and unimpressive persons of Mrs. Morgan and
      Jessica at least did her the office of relief by contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had made this reflection; she was not above it. Yet her actual
      goodness of heart saved her from ever feeling ashamed of the Morgans. It
      gratified her to think that she was doing them a substantial kindness; but
      for her, they would have dragged through a wretched summer in their
      unwholesome, jimcrack house, without a breath of pure air, without a sight
      of the free heaven. And to both of them that would probably have meant a
      grave illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morgan was a thin, tremulous woman, with watery eyes and a singular
      redness about the prominent part of her face, which seemed to indicate a
      determination of blood to the nose. All her married life had been spent in
      a cheerless struggle to maintain the externals of gentility. Not that she
      was vain or frivolous&mdash;indeed her natural tendencies made for
      homeliness in everything&mdash;but, by birth and by marriage connected
      with genteel people, she felt it impossible to abandon that mode of living
      which is supposed to distinguish the educated class from all beneath it.
      She had brought into the world three sons and three daughters; of the
      former, two were dead, and of the latter, one,&mdash;in each case, poverty
      of diet having proved fatal to a weak constitution. For close upon thirty
      years the family had lived in houses of which the rent was out of all
      reasonable proportion to their means; at present, with a total income of
      one hundred and sixty pounds (Mr. Morgan called himself a commission
      agent, and seldom had anything to do), they paid in rent and rates a
      matter of fifty-five, and bemoaned the fate which neighboured them with
      people only by courtesy to be called gentlefolk. Of course they kept a
      servant,&mdash;her wages nine pounds a year. Whilst the mother and elder
      daughter were at Teignmouth, Mr Morgan, his son, and the younger girl felt
      themselves justified in making up for lack of holiday by an extra supply
      of butcher&rsquo;s meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-meaning, but with as little discretion in this as in other things,
      Mrs. Morgan allowed scarce an hour of the day to pass without uttering her
      gratitude to Nancy Lord for the benefit she was enjoying. To escape these
      oppressive thanks, Nancy did her best never to be alone with the poor
      lady; but a <i>tete-a-tete</i> was occasionally unavoidable, as, for
      instance, on the third or fourth day after their arrival, when Mrs. Morgan
      had begged Nancy&rsquo;s company for a walk on the Den, whilst Jessica wrote
      letters. At the end of a tedious hour Jessica joined them, and her face
      had an unwonted expression. She beckoned her friend apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised. Who do you think is here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one that will bore us, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tarrant. I met him near the post-office, and he stopped me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they all here again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; he says he&rsquo;s alone.&mdash;One minute, mamma; please excuse us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was surprised to see you?&rsquo; said Nancy, after reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said so. But&mdash;I forgot to tell you&mdash;in a letter to Mrs.
      Baker I spoke of our plans. She had written to me to propose a pupil for
      after the holidays.&mdash;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t mention it to Mr. Tarrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently not!&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed, with some impatience. &lsquo;Why should you
      doubt his word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking&rsquo;&mdash;Jessica smiled archly&mdash;&lsquo;that he has
      come just to meet&mdash;somebody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody? Who do you mean?&rsquo; asked her friend, with a look of sincere
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may be mistaken&rsquo;&mdash;a glance completed the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rubbish!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that day the subject was unmentioned. Nancy kept rather to
      herself, and seemed meditative. Next morning she was in the same mood. The
      tide served for a bathe at eleven o&rsquo;clock; afterwards, as the girls walked
      briskly to and fro near the seat where Mrs. Morgan had established herself
      with a volume of Browning,&mdash;Jessica insisted on her reading Browning,
      though the poor mother protested that she scarcely understood a word,&mdash;they
      came full upon the unmistakable presence of Mr. Lionel Tarrant. Miss.
      Morgan, in acknowledging his salute, offered her hand; it was by her that
      the young man had stopped. Miss. Lord only bent her head, and that
      slightly. Tarrant expected more, but his half-raised hand dropped in time,
      and he directed his speech to Jessica. He had nothing to say but what
      seemed natural and civil; the dialogue&mdash;Nancy remained mute&mdash;occupied
      but a few minutes, and Tarrant went his way, sauntering landwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Morgan had observed the meeting, it was necessary to offer her an
      explanation. But Jessica gave only the barest facts concerning their
      acquaintance, and Nancy spoke as though she hardly knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was oppressively hot; in doors or out, little could be done
      but sit or lie in enervated attitudes, a state of things accordant with
      Nancy&rsquo;s mood. Till late at night she watched the blue starry sky from her
      open window, seeming to reflect, but in reality wafted on a stream of
      fancies and emotions. Jessica&rsquo;s explanation of the arrival of Lionel
      Tarrant had strangely startled her; no such suggestion would have occurred
      to her own mind. Yet now, she only feared that it might not be true. A
      debilitating climate and absolute indolence favoured that impulse of
      lawless imagination which had first possessed her on the evening of
      Jubilee Day. With luxurious heedlessness she cast aside every thought that
      might have sobered her; even as she at length cast off all her garments,
      and lay in the warm midnight naked upon her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physical attraction of which she had always been conscious in
      Tarrant&rsquo;s presence seemed to have grown stronger since she had dismissed
      him from her mind. Comparing him with Luckworth Crewe, she felt only a
      contemptuous distaste for the coarse vitality and vigour, whereto she had
      half surrendered herself, when hopeless of the more ambitious desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising early, she went out before breakfast, and found that a little rain
      had fallen. Grass and flowers were freshened; the air had an exquisite
      clearness, and a coolness which struck delightfully on the face, after the
      close atmosphere within doors. She had paused to watch a fishing-boat off
      shore, when a cheery voice bade her &lsquo;good-morning,&rsquo; and Tarrant stepped to
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are fond of this place,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not particularly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you choose it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does for a holiday as well as any other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gazing at her, and with the look which Nancy resented, the look
      which made her feel his social superiority. He seemed to observe her
      features with a condescending gratification. Though totally ignorant of
      his life and habits, she felt a conviction that he had often bestowed this
      look upon girls of a class below his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you like those advertisements of soaps and pills along the pier?&rsquo; 
      he asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see no harm in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perversity prompted her answer, but at once she remembered Crewe, and
      turned away in annoyance. Tarrant was only the more good-humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You like the world as it is? There&rsquo;s wisdom in that. Better be in harmony
      with one&rsquo;s time, advertisements and all.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;Are you reading for
      an exam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I? You are confusing me with Miss. Morgan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, not for a moment! I couldn&rsquo;t possibly confuse you with any one else.
      I know Miss. Morgan is studying professionally; but I thought you were
      reading for your own satisfaction, as so many women do now-a-days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction was flattering. Nancy yielded to the charm of his voice
      and conversed freely. It began to seem not impossible that he found some
      pleasure in her society. Now and then he dropped a word that made her
      pulses flutter; his eyes were constantly upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go off into the country sometimes?&rsquo; he inquired, when she had
      turned homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are thinking of having a drive to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I shall most likely have a ride; we may meet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy ordered a carriage for the afternoon, and with her friends drove up
      the Teign valley; but they did not meet Tarrant. But next morning he
      joined them on the pier, and this time Jessica had no choice but to
      present him to her mother. Nancy felt annoyed that this should have come
      about; Tarrant, she supposed, would regard poor Mrs. Morgan with secret
      ridicule. Yet, if that were his disposition, he concealed it perfectly; no
      one could have behaved with more finished courtesy. He seated himself by
      Mrs. Morgan, and talked with her of the simplest things in a pleasant,
      kindly humour. Yesterday, so he made known, he had ridden to Torquay and
      back, returning after sunset. This afternoon he was going by train to
      Exeter, to buy some books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he strolled about with Nancy, and talked of idle things with an
      almost excessive amiability. As the girl listened, a languor crept upon
      her, a soft and delicious subdual of the will to dreamy luxury. Her eyes
      were fixed on the shadows cast by her own figure and that of her
      companion. The black patches by chance touched. She moved so as to part
      them, and then changed her position so that they touched again&mdash;so
      that they blended.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nancy had written to her father, a short letter but affectionate, begging
      him to let her know whether the improvement in his health, of which he had
      spoken before she left home, still continued. The answer came without
      delay. On the whole, said Mr. Lord, he was doing well enough; no need
      whatever to trouble about him. He wrote only a few lines, but closed with
      &lsquo;love to you, my dear child,&rsquo; an unwonted effusiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time there came a letter from Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be surprised,&rsquo; it began, &lsquo;at the address I write from. As you
      know, I had planned to go to Brighton; but on the day before my holiday
      commenced I heard from F. F., saying that she and Mrs. Peachey had had a
      quarrel, and she was tired of Brighton, and was coming home. So I waited a
      day or two, and then, as I had half promised, I went to see Mrs. D. We had
      a long talk, and it ended in my telling her about F., and all the row
      there&rsquo;s been. Perhaps you will think I had better have kept it to myself,
      but Mrs. D. and I are on first-rate terms, and she seems to understand me
      better than any one I ever met. We talked about my holiday, and she
      persuaded me to come to Scarborough, where she herself was going for a
      week or two. It&rsquo;s rather an expensive affair, but worth the money. Of
      course I have lodgings of my own. Mrs. D. is at a big hotel, where friends
      of hers are staying. I have been introduced to two or three people, great
      swells, and I&rsquo;ve had lunch with Mrs. D. at the hotel twice. This kind of
      life suits me exactly. I don&rsquo;t think I get on badly with the swells. Of
      course I say not a word about my position, and of course nobody would
      think of asking questions. You would like this place; I rather wish you
      were here. Of course father thinks I have come on my own hook. It&rsquo;s very
      awkward having to keep a secret of this kind; I must try and persuade Mrs.
      D. to have a talk with father. But one thing I can tell you,&mdash;I feel
      pretty sure that she will get me, somehow or other, out of that beastly
      City life; she&rsquo;s always talking of things I might do. But not a word to
      any one about all this&mdash;be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This news caused Nancy to ponder for a long time. The greater part of the
      morning she spent at home, and in her own room; after lunch, she sat idly
      on the promenade, little disposed for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the second day since Tarrant had told her that he was going to
      Exeter, and they had not again met; the Morgans had not seen him either.
      The next morning, however, as all three were sitting in one of their
      favourite places, Tarrant approached them. Mrs. Morgan, who was fluttered
      by the natural supposition of a love affair between Miss. Lord and the
      interesting young man, made it easy for them to talk together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you get your books?&rsquo; Nancy asked, when silence followed on
      trivialities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and spent half a day with them in a favourite retreat of mine,
      inland. It&rsquo;s a very beautiful spot. I should like you to see it. Indeed,
      you ought to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy turned her eyes to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might walk over there one afternoon,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Morgan can&rsquo;t walk far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should we trouble her? Are you obliged to remain under Mrs. Morgan&rsquo;s
      wing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said jestingly, but Nancy felt piqued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not. I am quite independent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I should have supposed. Then why not come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed perfectly self-possessed, but the voice was not quite his own.
      To Nancy, her eyes still looking straight forward, it sounded as though
      from a distance; it had an effect upon her nerves similar to that she had
      experienced three days ago, when they were walking about the pier. Her
      hands fell idly; she leaned back more heavily on the seat; a weight was on
      her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A country ramble of an hour or two,&rsquo; pursued the voice, which itself had
      become languorous. &lsquo;Surely you are sometimes alone? It isn&rsquo;t necessary to
      give a detailed account of your time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered impatiently. &lsquo;Of course not.&rsquo; In this moment her thoughts had
      turned to Luckworth Crewe, and she was asking herself why this invitation
      of Tarrant&rsquo;s affected her so very differently from anything she had felt
      when Crewe begged her to meet him in London. With him she could go
      anywhere, enjoying a genuine independence, a complete self-confidence,
      thinking her unconventional behaviour merely good fun. Tarrant&rsquo;s proposal
      startled her. She was not mistress of the situation, as when trifling with
      Crewe. A sense of peril caused her heart to beat quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This afternoon, then,&rsquo; the voice was murmuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered mechanically. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to rain, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not. But, if so, to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow is Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Monday, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy heard him smother a laugh. She wished to look at him, but could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t rain,&rsquo; he continued, still with the ease of one who speaks of
      everyday matters. &lsquo;We shall see, at all events. Perhaps you will want to
      change your book at the library.&rsquo; A novel lay on her lap. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it
      an open possibility&mdash;to meet there about three o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy pointed out to sea, and asked where the steamer just passing might
      be bound for. Her companion readily turned to this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain&mdash;she half hoped for it&mdash;did not come. By luncheon-time
      every doubtful cloud had vanished. Before sitting down to table, she
      observed the sky at the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lovely weather!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Morgan behind her. &lsquo;But for you, dear Nancy,
      I should have been dreaming and wishing&mdash;oh, how vainly!&mdash;in the
      stifling town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have another drive this afternoon,&rsquo; Nancy declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how delightful! But pray, pray, not on our account&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jessica,&rsquo;&mdash;Nancy turned to her friend, who had just entered the
      room,&mdash;&lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have the carriage at three. And a better horse than
      last time; I&rsquo;ll take good care of that. Pen, ink, and paper!&rsquo; she cried
      joyously. &lsquo;The note shall go round at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a magnificent sort of person,&rsquo; said Jessica. &lsquo;Some day, no doubt,
      you&rsquo;ll keep a carriage and pair of your own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t I, just! And drive you down to Burlington House, for your exams.
      By-the-bye, does a female Bachelor of Arts lose her degree if she gets
      married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was sprightlier than of late. Her mood maintained itself throughout
      the first half of the drive, then she seemed to be overcome by a sudden
      weariness, ceased to talk, and gave only a listless look at things which
      interested her companions. By when they reached home again, she had a pale
      troubled countenance. Until dinner nothing more was seen of her, and after
      the meal she soon excused herself on the plea of a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there passed two days, Sunday and Monday, without Tarrant&rsquo;s
      appearing. Mrs. Morgan and Jessica privately talked much of the
      circumstance. Sentimental souls, they found this topic inexhaustible;
      Jessica, having her mind thus drawn away from Burlington House, benefited
      not a little by the mystery of her friend&rsquo;s position; she thought,
      however, that Nancy might have practised a less severe reticence. To Mrs.
      Morgan it never occurred that so self-reliant a young woman as Miss. Lord
      stood in need of matronly counsel, of strict chaperonage; she would have
      deemed it an impertinence to allow herself the most innocent remark
      implying such a supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday afternoon, about three o&rsquo;clock, Nancy walked alone to the
      library. There, looking at books and photographs in the window, stood
      Lionel Tarrant. He greeted her as usual, seemed not to remark the hot
      colour in her cheeks, and stepped with her into the shop. She had meant to
      choose a novel, but, with Tarrant looking on, felt constrained to exhibit
      her capacity for severe reading. The choice of grave works was not large,
      and she found it difficult to command her thoughts even for the perusal of
      titles; however, she ultimately discovered a book that promised anything
      but frivolity, Helmholtz&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lectures on Scientific Subjects,&rsquo; and at this
      she clutched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two loudly-dressed women were at the same time searching the shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whether this is a pretty book?&rsquo; said one to the other, taking
      down a trio of volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it looks as if it might be pretty,&rsquo; returned her friend, examining
      the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      They faced to the person behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this a pretty book?&rsquo; one of them inquired loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, madam, that&rsquo;s a very pretty book&mdash;very pretty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy exchanged a glance with her companion and smiled. When they were
      outside again Tarrant asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you found a pretty book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed the title of her choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merciful heavens! You mean to read that? The girls of to-day! What mere
      man is worthy of them? But&mdash;I must rise to the occasion. We&rsquo;ll have a
      chapter as we rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insensibly, Nancy had followed the direction he chose. His words took for
      granted that she was going into the country with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends are on the pier,&rsquo; she said, abruptly stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where doubtless they will enjoy themselves. Let me carry your book,
      please. Helmholtz is rather heavy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks, I can carry it very well. I shall turn this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. My way this afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy stood still, looking up the street that led towards the sea. She was
      still bright-coloured; her lips had a pathetic expression, a child-like
      pouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was an understanding,&rsquo; said Tarrant, with playful firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. For the day when you disappointed me. The day after, I didn&rsquo;t think
      it worth while to come here; yesterday I came, but felt no surprise that I
      didn&rsquo;t meet you. To-day I had a sort of hope. This way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed, and they walked for several minutes in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me look at Helmholtz?&rsquo; said the young man at length. &lsquo;Most
      excellent book, of course. &ldquo;Physiological Causes of Harmony in Music,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Interaction of Natural Forces,&rdquo; &ldquo;Conservation of Force.&rdquo;&mdash;You enjoy
      this kind of thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One must know something about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so. I used to grind at science because everybody talked
      science. In reality I loathed it, and now I read only what I like. Life&rsquo;s
      too short for intellectual make-believe. It is too short for anything but
      enjoyment. Tell me what you read for pure pleasure. Poetry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left the streets, and were pursuing a road bordered with gardens,
      gardens of glowing colour, sheltered amid great laurels, shadowed by
      stately trees; the air was laden with warm scents of flower and leaf. On
      an instinct of resistance, Nancy pretended that the exact sciences were
      her favourite study. She said it in the tone of superiority which habit
      had made natural to her in speaking of intellectual things. And Tarrant
      appeared to accept her declaration without scepticism; but, a moment
      after, he turned the talk upon novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, for half an hour and more, they strolled on by upward ways, until
      Teignmouth lay beneath them, and the stillness of meadows all about.
      Presently Tarrant led from the beaten road into a lane all but overgrown
      with grass. He began to gather flowers, and offered them to Nancy.
      Personal conversation seemed at an end; they were enjoying the brilliant
      sky and the peaceful loveliness of earth. They exchanged simple, natural
      thoughts, or idle words in which was no thought at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, they came to an old broken gate, half open; it was the
      entrance to a narrow cartway, now unused, which descended windingly
      between high thick hedges. Ruts of a foot in depth, baked hard by summer,
      showed how miry the track must be in the season of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is our way,&rsquo; said Tarrant, his hand on the lichened wood. &lsquo;Better
      than the pier or the promenade, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we have gone far enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy drew back into the lane, looked at her flowers, and then shaded her
      eyes with them to gaze upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Almost. Another five minutes, and you will see the place I told you of.
      You can&rsquo;t imagine how beautiful it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another day&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all but there&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed regretfully to yield; and Nancy yielded in her turn. She felt a
      sudden shame in the thought of having perhaps betrayed timidity. Without
      speaking, she passed the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hedge on either side was of hazel and dwarf oak, of hawthorn and
      blackthorn, all intertwined with giant brambles, and with briers which
      here and there met overhead. High and low, blackberries hung in
      multitudes, swelling to purple ripeness. Numberless the trailing and
      climbing plants. Nancy&rsquo;s skirts rustled among the greenery; her cheeks
      were touched, as if with a caress, by many a drooping branchlet; in
      places, Tarrant had to hold the tangle above her while she stooped to
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from this they emerged into a small circular space, where the cartway
      made a turn at right angles and disappeared behind thickets. They were in
      the midst of a plantation; on every side trees closed about them, with a
      low and irregular hedge to mark the borders of the grassy road. Nancy&rsquo;s
      eyes fell at once upon a cluster of magnificent foxgloves, growing upon a
      bank which rose to the foot of an old elm; beside the foxgloves lay a
      short-hewn trunk, bedded in the ground, thickly overgrown with mosses,
      lichens, and small fungi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I misled you?&rsquo; said Tarrant, watching her face with frank pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed you haven&rsquo;t. This is very beautiful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I discovered it last year, and spent hours here alone. I couldn&rsquo;t ask you
      to come and see it then,&rsquo; he added, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is delightful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your seat,&mdash;who knows how many years it has waited for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down upon the old trunk. About the roots of the elm above grew
      masses of fern, and beneath it a rough bit of the bank was clothed with
      pennywort, the green discs and yellowing fruity spires making an exquisite
      patch of colour. In the shadow of bushes near at hand hartstongue
      abounded, with fronds hanging to the length of an arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Tarrant, gaily, &lsquo;you shall have some blackberries. And he went
      to gather them, returning in a few minutes with a large leaf full. He saw
      that Nancy, meanwhile, had taken up the book from where he dropped it to
      the ground; it lay open on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Helmholtz! Away with him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I have opened at something interesting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though possession of the book were of vital importance to
      her. Nevertheless, the fruit was accepted, and she drew off her gloves to
      eat it. Tarrant seated himself on the ground, near her, and gradually fell
      into a half-recumbent attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you have any?&rsquo; Nancy asked, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One or two, if you will give me them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose a fine blackberry, and held it out. Tarrant let it fall into his
      palm, and murmured, &lsquo;You have a beautiful hand.&rsquo; When, a moment after, he
      glanced at her, she seemed to be reading Helmholtz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm of the golden afternoon could not have been more profound. Birds
      twittered softly in the wood, and if a leaf rustled, it was only at the
      touch of wings. Earth breathed its many perfumes upon the slumberous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know,&rsquo; said Tarrant, after a long pause, and speaking as though he
      feared to break the hush, &lsquo;that Keats once stayed at Teignmouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy did not know it, but said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; The name of Keats was familiar to
      her, but of his life she knew hardly anything, of his poetry very little.
      Her education had been chiefly concerned with names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you read me a paragraph of Helmholtz?&rsquo; continued the other, looking
      at her with a smile. &lsquo;Any paragraph, the one before you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, but read at length, in an unsteady voice, something about
      the Conservation of Force. It ended in a nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll read something to you,&rsquo; said Tarrant. And he began to repeat,
      slowly, musically, lines of verse which his companion had never heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>O what can ail thee, Knight-at-arms, Alone and palely loitering? The
      sedge has wither&rsquo;d from the lake, And no birds sing</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went through the poem; Nancy the while did not stir. It was as though
      he murmured melody for his own pleasure, rather than recited to a
      listener; but no word was inaudible. Nancy knew that his eyes rested upon
      her; she wished to smile, yet could not. And when he ceased, the silence
      held her motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better?&rsquo; said Tarrant, drawing slightly nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to know thousands of verses by heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever write any?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Half-a-dozen epics or so, when I was about seventeen. Yet, I don&rsquo;t come
      of a poetical family. My father&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly, looked into Nancy&rsquo;s face with a smile, and said in a
      tone of playfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember asking me whether I had anything to do with&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, flushing over all her features, exclaimed, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t! please don&rsquo;t!
      I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it. But we know each other better now. You were quite
      right. That was how my grandfather made his money. My father, I believe,
      got through most of it, and gave no particular thought to me. His mother&mdash;the
      old lady whom you know&mdash;had plenty of her own&mdash;to be mine, she
      tells me, some day. Do you wish to be forgiven for hurting my pride?&rsquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what made me say such a thing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered the words; she felt her will subdued. Tarrant reached a hand,
      and took one of hers, and kissed it; then allowed her to draw it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now will you give me another blackberry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was trembling; a light shone in her eyes. She offered the leaf
      with fruit in it; Tarrant, whilst choosing, touched the blue veins of her
      wrist with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; she asked presently. &lsquo;I mean, what do you aim
      at in life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enjoyment. Why should I trouble about anything else. I should be content
      if life were all like this: to look at a beautiful face, and listen to a
      voice that charms me, and touch a hand that makes me thrill with such
      pleasure as I never knew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s waste of time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never time was spent so well! Look at me again like that&mdash;with
      the eyes half-closed, and the lips half-mocking. Oh, the exquisite lips!
      If I might&mdash;if I might&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stir from his posture of languid ease, but Nancy, with a quick
      movement, drew a little away from him, then rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to go back,&rsquo; she said absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; not yet. Let me look at you for a few minutes more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to walk slowly, head bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, to-morrow, or the day after. The place will be just as
      beautiful, and you even more. The sea-air makes you lovelier from day to
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked back for an instant. Tarrant followed, and in the deep leafy
      way he again helped her to pass the briers. But their hands never touched,
      and the silence was unbroken until they had issued into the open lane.

      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lodgings were taken for three weeks, and more than half the time had
      now elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica, who declared herself quite well and strong again, though her face
      did not bear out the assertion, was beginning to talk of matters
      examinational once more. Notwithstanding protests, she brought forth from
      their hiding-place sundry arid little manuals and black-covered notebooks;
      her thoughts were divided between algebraic formulae and Nancy&rsquo;s relations
      with Lionel Tarrant. Perhaps because no secret was confided to her, she
      affected more appetite for the arid little books than she really felt.
      Nancy would neither speak of examinations, nor give ear when they were
      talked about; she, whether consciously or not, was making haste to
      graduate in quite another school.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after her long walk with Tarrant, she woke before sunrise,
      and before seven o&rsquo;clock had left the house. A high wind and hurrying
      clouds made the weather prospects uncertain. She strayed about the Den,
      never losing sight for more than a minute or two of the sea-fronting house
      where Tarrant lived. But no familiar form approached her, and she had to
      return to breakfast unrewarded for early rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the day she was restless and silent, kept alone as much as
      possible, and wore a look which, as the hours went on, darkened from
      anxiety to ill-humour. She went to bed much earlier than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven next morning, having lingered behind her friends, she found
      Tarrant in conversation with Mrs. Morgan and Jessica on the pier. His
      greeting astonished her; it had precisely the gracious formality of a year
      ago; a word or two about the weather, and he resumed his talk with Miss.
      Morgan&mdash;its subject, the educational value of the classics. Obliged
      to listen, Nancy suffered an anguish of resentful passion. For a quarter
      of an hour she kept silence, then saw the young man take leave and saunter
      away with that air which, in satire, she had formerly styled majestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then passed three whole days, during which Lionel was not seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the fourth, between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, found Nancy at
      the door of the house which her thoughts had a thousand times visited. A
      servant, in reply to inquiry, told her that Mr Tarrant was in London; he
      would probably return to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked idly away&mdash;and, at less than a hundred yards&rsquo; distance,
      met Tarrant himself. His costume showed that he had just come from the
      railway station. Nancy would gladly have walked straight past him, but the
      tone in which he addressed her was a new surprise, and she stood in
      helpless confusion. He had been to London&mdash;called away on sudden
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought of writing&mdash;nay, I did write, but after all didn&rsquo;t post
      the letter. For a very simple reason&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t remember your
      address.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he laughed so naturally, that the captive walked on by his side,
      unresisting. Their conversation lasted only a few minutes, then Nancy
      resolutely bade him good-night, no appointment made for the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day of showers, then a day of excessive heat. They saw each other
      several times, but nothing of moment passed. The morning after they met
      before breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow is our last day,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mrs. Morgan told me.&rsquo; Nancy herself had never spoken of departure.
      &lsquo;This afternoon we&rsquo;ll go up the hill again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall care to walk so far. Look at the mist; it&rsquo;s going
      to be dreadfully hot again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant was in a mood of careless gaiety; his companion appeared to
      struggle against listlessness, and her cheek had lost its wonted colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have tea at four or five, I suppose. Let us go after that, when the
      heat of the day is over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, after various objections, Nancy consented. Through the hours of
      glaring sunshine she stayed at home, lying inert, by an open window. Over
      the tea-cups she was amiable, but dreamy. When ready to go out, she just
      looked into the sitting-room, where Jessica bent over books, and said
      cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may be a little late for dinner. On no account wait&mdash;I forbid it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, without listening to the answer, she hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the upward climbing lanes, no breeze yet tempered the still air; the
      sky of misted sapphire showed not a cloud from verge to verge. Tarrant, as
      if to make up for his companion&rsquo;s silence, talked ceaselessly, and always
      in light vein. Sunshine, he said, was indispensable to his life; he never
      passed the winter in London; if he were the poorest of mortals, he would,
      at all events, beg his bread in a sunny clime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to the Bahamas this winter?&rsquo; Nancy asked, mentioning the
      matter for the first time since she heard of it at Champion Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Everything is uncertain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he put the question aside as if it were of no importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the old gate, and breathed with relief in the never-broken
      shadow of tangled foliage. Whilst pushing a bramble aside, Tarrant let his
      free arm fall lightly on Nancy&rsquo;s waist. At once she sprang forward, but
      without appearing to notice what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay&mdash;did you ever see such ivy as this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mass of large, lustrous leaves, concealing a rotten trunk. Whilst
      Nancy looked on, Tarrant pulled at a long stem, and tried to break it
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must cut it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He wove three stems into a wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There now, take off your hat, and let me crown you. Have I made it too
      large for the little head?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, after a moment&rsquo;s reluctance, unfastened her hat, and stood
      bareheaded, blushing and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do your hair in the right way&mdash;the Greek way. A diadem on the
      top&mdash;the only way when the hair and the head are beautiful. It leaves
      the outline free&mdash;the exquisite curve that unites neck and head. Now
      the ivy wreath; and how will you look?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a dress of thin, creamy material, which, whilst seeming to cumber
      her as little as garments could, yet fitted closely enough to declare the
      healthy beauty of her form. The dark green garland, for which she bent a
      little, became her admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I pictured it in my letter,&rsquo; said Tarrant, &lsquo;the letter you never got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I burnt it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me what was in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All sorts of things&mdash;a long letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s all nonsense about forgetting my address.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mere truth. In fact, I never knew it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be so good as to tell me,&rsquo; she spoke as she walked on before him, &lsquo;what
      you meant by your behaviour that morning before you went to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how did I behave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very strangely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant affected not to understand; but, when she again turned, Nancy saw
      a mischievous smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bit of nonsense.&mdash;Shall I tell you?&rsquo; He stepped near, and suddenly
      caught both her hands,&mdash;one of them was trailing her sunshade.
      &lsquo;Forgive me in advance&mdash;will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rsquo; And she tried, though faintly, to get free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I will make you&mdash;now, refuse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips had just touched hers, just touched and no more. Rosy red, she
      trembled before him with drooping eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It meant nothing at all, really,&rsquo; he pursued, his voice at its softest.
      &lsquo;A sham trial&mdash;to see whether I was hopelessly conquered or not. Of
      course I was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You dare to doubt it?&mdash;I understand now what the old poet meant,
      when he talked of bees seeking honey on his lady&rsquo;s lips. That fancy isn&rsquo;t
      so artificial as it seemed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very pretty&rsquo;&mdash;she spoke between quick breaths, and tried
      to laugh&mdash;&lsquo;but you have thrown my hat on the ground. Give it me, and
      take the ivy for yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no Bacchus.&rsquo; He tossed the wreath aside. &lsquo;Take the hat; I like you
      in it just as well.&mdash;You shall have a girdle of woodbine, instead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe your explanation,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not believe me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With feigned indignation, he moved to capture her again; but Nancy
      escaped. Her hat in her hand, she darted forward. A minute&rsquo;s run brought
      her into the open space, and there, with an exclamation of surprise, she
      stopped. Tarrant, but a step or two behind her, saw at almost the same
      moment the spectacle which had arrested her flight. Before them stood two
      little donkeys munching eagerly at a crop of rosy-headed thistles. They&mdash;the
      human beings&mdash;looked at each other; Tarrant burst into extravagant
      laughter, and Nancy joined him. Neither&rsquo;s mirth was spontaneous; Nancy&rsquo;s
      had a note of nervous tension, a ring of something like recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can they come from?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must have strayed a long way. I haven&rsquo;t seen any farm or cottage.&mdash;But
      perhaps some one is with them. Wait, I&rsquo;ll go on a little, and see if some
      boy is hanging about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the sharp corner, and disappeared. For two or three minutes
      Nancy stood alone, watching the patient little grey beasts, whose pendent
      ears, with many a turn and twitch, expressed their joy in the feast of
      thistles. She watched them in seeming only; her eyes beheld nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice sounded from behind her&mdash;&lsquo;Nancy!&rsquo; Startled, she saw Tarrant
      standing high up, in a gap of the hedge, on the bank which bordered the
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you get there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Went round.&rsquo; He showed the direction with his hand. &lsquo;I can see no one,
      but somebody may come. It&rsquo;s wonderful here, among the trees. Come over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I?&mdash;We will drive the donkeys away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it&rsquo;s much better here; a wild wood, full of wonderful things. The
      bank isn&rsquo;t too steep. Give me your hand, and you can step up easily, just
      at this place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your sunshade first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too much trouble,&rsquo; she said languidly, all but plaintively. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
      rather be here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obey!&mdash;Your sunshade&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was kneeling on the top of the bank. With very little exertion, Nancy
      found herself beside him. Then he at once leapt down among the brushwood,
      a descent of some three feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall be trespassing,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I care? Now, jump!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if you could catch me!&rsquo; Again she uttered her nervous laugh. &lsquo;I am
      heavy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obey! Jump!&rsquo; he cried impatiently, his eyes afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt, seated herself, dropped forward. Tarrant caught her in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heavy! a feather weight! Why, I can carry you; I could run with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did carry her through the brushwood, away into the shadow of the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner-time, Mrs. Morgan and her daughter were alone. They agreed to
      wait a quarter of an hour, and sat silent, pretending each to be engaged
      with a book. At length their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it mean, Jessica?&rsquo; asked the mother timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. It doesn&rsquo;t concern us. She didn&rsquo;t mean to be back,
      by what she said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it rather&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Nancy is all right. I suppose she&rsquo;ll have something to tell you,
      to-night or to-morrow. We must have dinner; I&rsquo;m hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I, dear.&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m quite afraid to think of the appetites we&rsquo;re
      taking back. Poor Milly will be terrified.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight o&rsquo;clock, nine o&rsquo;clock. The two conversed in subdued voices; Mrs.
      Morgan was anxious, all but distressed. Half-past nine. &lsquo;What <i>can</i>
      it mean, Jessica? I can&rsquo;t help feeling a responsibility. After all, Nancy
      is quite a young girl; and I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought she might be steadier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! That was a knock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited. In a minute or two the door was opened a few inches, and a
      voice called &lsquo;Jessica!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She responded. Nancy was standing in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come into my room,&rsquo; she said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived there, she did not strike a light. She closed the door, and took
      hold of her friend&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go back the day after to-morrow, Jessica. We must wait a day
      longer, till the afternoon of Friday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter, Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing serious. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, I&rsquo;m tired, and I shall go to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why must we wait?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen: will you promise me faithfully&mdash;as friend to friend, faith
      fully&mdash;not to tell the reason even to your mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, faithfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, it&rsquo;s this. On Friday morning I shall be married to Mr Tarrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gracious!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may tell you more, before then; but perhaps not. We shall be married by
      licence, and it needs one day between getting the licence and the
      marriage. You may tell your mother, if you like, that I want to stay
      longer on <i>his</i> account. I don&rsquo;t care; of course she suspects
      something. But not a syllable to hint at the truth. I have been your best
      friend for a long time, and I trust you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a passionate whisper, and Jessica felt her trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t have the least fear of me, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it. Kiss me, and good-night!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      During his daughter&rsquo;s absence, Stephen Lord led a miserable life. The
      wasting disease had firm hold upon him; day by day it consumed his flesh,
      darkened his mind. The more need he had of nursing and restraint, the less
      could he tolerate interference with his habits, invasion of his gloomy
      solitude. The doctor&rsquo;s visits availed nothing; he listened to advice, or
      seemed to listen, but with a smile of obstinate suspicion on his furrowed
      face which conveyed too plain a meaning to the adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one point Mary had prevailed with him. After some days&rsquo; resistance, he
      allowed her to transform the cabin-like arrangements of his room, and give
      it the appearance of a comfortable bed-chamber. But he would not take to
      his bed, and the suggestion of professional nursing excited his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you write to Nancy?&rsquo; he asked one morning of his faithful attendant,
      with scowling suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are telling me the truth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never write to any one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Understand plainly that I won&rsquo;t have a word said to her about me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was when Horace had gone away to Scarborough, believing, on his
      father&rsquo;s assurance, that there was no ground whatever for anxiety.
      Sometimes Mr. Lord sat hour after hour in an unchanging position, his dull
      eyes scarcely moving from one point. At others he paced his room, or
      wandered about the house, or made an attempt at gardening&mdash;which soon
      ended in pain and exhaustion. Towards night he became feverish, his hollow
      cheeks glowing with an ominous tint. In the morning he occasionally
      prepared himself as if to start for his place of business; he left the
      house, and walked for perhaps a couple of hundred yards, then slackened
      his pace, stopped, looked about him in an agony of indecision, and at
      length returned. After this futile endeavour, he had recourse to the
      bottles in his cupboard, and presently fell into a troubled sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the second week, early one evening, three persons came to
      him by appointment: his partner Samuel Barmby, Mr. Barmby, senior, and a
      well-dressed gentleman whom Mary&mdash;she opened the door to them&mdash;had
      never seen before. They sat together in the drawing-room for more than an
      hour; then the well-dressed gentleman took his leave, the others remaining
      for some time longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promoted servant, at Mr. Lord&rsquo;s bidding, had made a change in her
      dress; during the latter part of the day she presented the appearance of a
      gentlewoman, and sat, generally with needlework, sometimes with a book,
      alone in the dining-room. On a Sunday, whilst Nancy and her brother were
      away, the Barmby family&mdash;father, son, and two daughters&mdash;came to
      take tea and spend the evening, Mary doing the honours of the house; she
      bore herself without awkwardness, talked simply, and altogether justified
      Mr. Lord&rsquo;s opinion of her. When the guests were gone, Stephen made no
      remark, but, in saying good-night to her, smiled for an instant&mdash;the
      first smile seen upon his face for many days.

    <p>
      Mary remained ignorant of the disease from which he was suffering; in the
      matter of his diet, she consulted and obeyed him, though often enough it
      seemed to her that his choice suited little with the state of an invalid.
      He ate at irregular times, and frequently like a starving man. Mary
      suspected that, on the occasions when he went out for half-an-hour after
      dark, he brought back food with him: she had seen him enter with something
      concealed beneath his coat. All his doings were to her a subject of
      ceaseless anxiety, of a profound distress which, in his presence, she was
      obliged to conceal. If she regarded him sadly, the sufferer grew petulant
      or irate. He would not endure a question concerning his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day which was understood to be Nancy&rsquo;s last at Teignmouth, he
      brightened a little, and talked with pleasure, as it seemed, of her return
      on the morrow. Horace had written that he would be home this evening, but
      Mr. Lord spoke only of his daughter. At about six o&rsquo;clock he was sitting
      in the garden, and Mary brought him a letter just delivered; he looked at
      the envelope with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell us the train she&rsquo;s coming by, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary waited. When Mr. Lord had read the brief note, his face darkened,
      first with disappointment, then with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, look at it,&rsquo; he said harshly. &lsquo;What else was to be expected?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest Father,&rsquo; wrote Nancy, &lsquo;I am sorry that our return must be put
      off; we hope to get back on Friday evening. Of course this will make no
      difference to you.&mdash;With best love, dear father, and hoping I shall
      find you much better&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does she mean by behaving in this way?&rsquo; resumed the angry voice,
      before Mary had read to the end. &lsquo;What does she mean by it? Who gave her
      leave to stay longer? Not a word of explanation. How does she know it will
      make no difference to me? What does she mean by it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fine weather has tempted them,&rsquo; replied Mary. &lsquo;I daresay they want to
      go somewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What right has she to make the change at a moment&rsquo;s notice?&rsquo; vociferated
      the father, his voice suddenly recovering its old power, his cheeks and
      neck suffused with red wrath. &lsquo;And hopes she will find me better. What
      does <i>she</i> care whether she finds me alive or dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! You wouldn&rsquo;t let her know that you were worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it mean? I hate this deceitful behaviour! She knew before, of
      course she knew; and she left it to the last moment, so that I couldn&rsquo;t
      write and prevent her from staying. As if I should have wished to! As if I
      cared a brass farthing how long she stays, or, for that matter, whether I
      ever see her again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked the course of his furious speech, and stood staring at the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; He spoke now in a hoarse undertone. &lsquo;You thought they
      were going somewhere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last year there used to be steamers that went to places on certain days&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! She wouldn&rsquo;t alter all their plans for that. It&rsquo;s something I
      am not to know&mdash;of course it is. She&rsquo;s deceitful&mdash;like all
      women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Mary&rsquo;s eye, suddenly turned upon him. His own fell before it, and
      without speaking again he went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half-an-hour&rsquo;s time his bell rang, and not Mary, but the young servant
      responded. According to her directions, she knocked at the door, and,
      without opening it, asked her master&rsquo;s pleasure. Mr. Lord said that he was
      going out, and would not require a meal till late in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when he returned. Mary, sitting in the front
      room, rose at his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want nothing,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the Barmbys&rsquo;.&rsquo; Voice and
      movements proved how the effort had taxed him. In sitting down, he
      trembled; fever was in his eyes, and pain in every line of his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary handed him a letter; it came from Horace, and was an intimation that
      the young gentleman would not return to-night, but to-morrow. When Mr.
      Lord had read it, he jerked a contemptuous laugh, and threw the sheet of
      note-paper across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are. Not much to choose between daughter and son. He&rsquo;s due at
      business in the morning; but what does that matter? It doesn&rsquo;t suit his
      lordship to keep time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, his emphasis on &lsquo;lordship&rsquo; showing that he consciously
      played with the family name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I was a fool to be angry. Let them come when they will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes he lay back in the chair, gazing at vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has the girl gone to bed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her she can go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary soon returned, and took up the book with which she had been engaged.
      In a low voice, and as if speaking without much thought, Stephen asked her
      what she was reading. It was a volume of an old magazine, bought by Mr.
      Lord many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes. Nancy laughs at it&mdash;calls it old rubbish. These young
      people are so clever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion made no remark. Unobserved, he scrutinised her face for a
      long time, and said at length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let <i>us</i> fall out, Mary. You&rsquo;re not pleased with me, and I
      know why. I said all women were deceitful, and you took it too seriously.
      You ought to know me better. There&rsquo;s something comes on me every now and
      then, and makes me say the worst I can no matter who it hurts. Could I be
      such a fool as to think ill of <i>you</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It did hurt me,&rsquo; replied the other, still bent over her book. &lsquo;But it was
      only the sound of it. I knew you said more than you meant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a fool, and I&rsquo;ve been a fool all my life. Is it likely I should have
      wise children? When I went off to the Barmbys&rsquo;, I thought of sending
      Samuel down to Teignmouth, to find out what they were at. But I altered my
      mind before I got there. What good would it have done? All I <i>can</i> do
      I&rsquo;ve done already. I made my will the other day; it&rsquo;s signed and
      witnessed. I&rsquo;ve made it as I told you I should. I&rsquo;m not much longer for
      this world, but I&rsquo;ve saved the girl from foolishness till she&rsquo;s
      six-and-twenty. After that she must take care of herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat silent whilst the clock on the mantelpiece ticked away a few more
      minutes. Mr. Lord&rsquo;s features betrayed the working of turbid thought, a
      stern resentment their prevailing expression. When reverie released him,
      he again looked at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary, did you ever ask yourself what sort of woman Nancy&rsquo;s mother may
      have been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener started, like one in whom a secret has been surprised. She
      tried to answer, but after all did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; Stephen pursued. &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you. You must know it.
      Not a year after the boy&rsquo;s birth, she left me. And I made myself free of
      her&mdash;I divorced her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes just met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t think that it cost me any suffering. Not on her account; not
      because I had lost my wife. I never felt so glad, before or since, as on
      the day when it was all over, and I found myself a free man again. I
      suffered only in thinking how I had fooled away some of the best years of
      my life for a woman who despised me from the first, and was as heartless
      as the stones of the street. I found her in beggary, or close upon it. I
      made myself her slave&mdash;it&rsquo;s only the worthless women who accept from
      a man, who expect from him, such slavish worship as she had from me. I
      gave her clothing; she scarcely thanked me, but I thought myself happy. I
      gave her a comfortable home, such as she hadn&rsquo;t known for years; for a
      reward she mocked at my plain tastes and quiet ways&mdash;but I thought no
      ill of it&mdash;could see nothing in it but a girlish, lighthearted sort
      of way that seemed one of her merits. As long as we lived together, she
      pretended to be an affectionate wife; I should think no one ever matched
      her in hypocrisy. But the first chance she had&mdash;husband, children,
      home, all flung aside in a moment. Then I saw her in the true light, and
      understood all at once what a blind fool I had been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He breathed quickly and painfully. Mary sat without a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I had done a great thing in marrying a wife that was born above
      me. Her father had been a country gentleman; horse-racing and such things
      had brought him down, and from her twelfth year his daughter lived&mdash;I
      never quite knew how, but on charity of some kind. She grew up without
      trying to earn her own living; she thought herself too good for that,
      thought she had a claim to be supported, because as a child she was waited
      upon by servants. When I asked her once if she couldn&rsquo;t have done
      something, she stared at me and laughed in my face. For all that she was
      glad enough to marry a man of my sort&mdash;rough and uneducated as I was.
      She always reminded me of it, though&mdash;that I had no education; I
      believe she thought that she had a perfect right to throw over such a
      husband, whenever she chose. Afterwards, I saw very well that <i>her</i>
      education didn&rsquo;t amount to much. How could it, when she learnt nothing
      after she was twelve? She was living with very poor people who came from
      my part of the country&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I met her. The father led some
      sort of blackguard life in London, but had no money for her, nor yet for
      his other girl, who went into service, I was told, and perhaps made
      herself a useful, honest woman. He died in a hospital, and he was buried
      at my expense&mdash;not three months before his daughter went off and left
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will never tell your children,&rsquo; said Mary, when there had been a long
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought it would only be right if I told them. I&rsquo;ve often
      thought, the last year or two, that Nancy ought to know. It might make her
      think, and do her good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; returned the other hurriedly. &lsquo;Never let her know of it&mdash;never.
      It might do her much harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know now, Mary, why I look at the girl so anxiously. She&rsquo;s not like
      her mother; not much like her in face, and I can&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s like her in
      heart. But you know what her faults are as well as I do. Whether I&rsquo;ve been
      right or wrong in giving her a good education, I shall never know. Wrong,
      I fear&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve told you all about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know whether she&rsquo;s alive or not?&rsquo; asked Mary, when once more it
      was left to her to break silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I care? How should I know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be tempted to tell them&mdash;either of them!&rsquo; said the other
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend Barmby knows. Whether he&rsquo;s told his son, I can&rsquo;t say; it&rsquo;s
      twenty years since we spoke about it. If he <i>did</i> ever mention it to
      Samuel, then it might somehow get known to Horace or the girl, when I&rsquo;m
      gone.&mdash;I won&rsquo;t give up the hope that young Barmby may be her husband.
      She&rsquo;ll have time to think about it. But if ever she should come to you and
      ask questions&mdash;I mean, if she&rsquo;s been told what happened&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      set me right in her eyes? You&rsquo;ll tell her what I&rsquo;ve told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it may never&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; Stephen interrupted, his voice husky with fatigue. &lsquo;But I count
      on you to make my girl think rightly of me, if ever there&rsquo;s occasion. I
      count on you. When I&rsquo;m dead, I won&rsquo;t have her think that I was to blame
      for her mother&rsquo;s ill-doing. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve told you. You believe me,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary, lifting her eyes, met his look of appeal with more than a
      friend&rsquo;s confidence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      From chambers in Staple Inn, Lionel Tarrant looked forth upon the
      laborious world with a dainty enjoyment of his own limitless leisure. The
      old gables fronting upon Holborn pleased his fancy; he liked to pass under
      the time-worn archway, and so, at a step, estrange himself from commercial
      tumult,&mdash;to be in the midst of modern life, yet breathe an atmosphere
      of ancient repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He belonged to an informal club of young men who called themselves,
      facetiously, the Hodiernals. <i>Vixi hodie</i>! The motto, suggested by
      some one or other after a fifth tumbler of whisky punch, might bear more
      than a single interpretation. Harvey Munden, the one member of this genial
      brotherhood who lived by the sweat of his brow, proposed as a more
      suitable title, Les Faineants; that, however, was judged pedantic, not to
      say offensive. For these sons of the Day would not confess to indolence;
      each deemed himself, after his own fashion, a pioneer in art, letters,
      civilisation. They had money of their own, or were supported by some one
      who could afford that privilege; most of them had, ostensibly, some
      profession in view; for the present, they contented themselves with
      living, and the weaker brethren read in their hodiernity an obligation to
      be &lsquo;up to date.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant professed himself critical of To-day, apprehensive of To-morrow;
      he cast a backward eye. None the less, his avowed principle was to savour
      the passing hour. When night grew mellow, and the god of whisky inspired
      his soul, he shone in a lyrical egoism which had but slight correspondence
      with the sincerities of his solitude. His view of woman&mdash;the
      Hodiernals talked much of woman&mdash;differed considerably from his
      thoughts of the individual women with whom he associated; protesting
      oriental sympathies, he nourished in truth the chivalry appropriate to his
      years and to his education, and imaged an ideal of female excellence
      whereof the prime features were moral and intellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no money of his own. What could be saved for him from his father&rsquo;s
      squandered estate&mdash;the will established him sole inheritor&mdash;went
      in the costs of a liberal education, his grandmother giving him assurance
      that he should not go forth into the world penniless. This promise Mrs.
      Tarrant had kept, though not exactly in the manner her grandson desired.
      Instead of making him a fixed allowance, the old lady supplied him with
      funds at uncertain intervals; with the unpleasant result that it was
      sometimes necessary for him to call to her mind his dependent condition.
      The cheques he received varied greatly in amount,&mdash;from handsome
      remittances of a hundred pounds or so, down to minim gifts which made the
      young man feel uncomfortable when he received them. Still, he was provided
      for, and it could not be long before this dependency came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed in his own abilities. Should it ever be needful, he could turn
      to journalism, for which, undoubtedly, he had some aptitude. But why do
      anything at all, in the sense of working for money? Every year he felt
      less disposed for that kind of exertion, and had a greater relish of his
      leisurely life. Mrs. Tarrant never rebuked him; indeed she had long since
      ceased to make inquiry about his professional views. Perhaps she felt it
      something of a dignity to have a grandson who lived as gentleman at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, in the latter days of August, the gentleman found himself, in one
      most important particular, at large no longer. On returning from
      Teignmouth to Staple Inn he entered his rooms with a confused,
      disagreeable sense that things were not as they had been, that his freedom
      had suffered a violation, that he could not sit down among his books with
      the old self-centred ease, that his prospects were completely,
      indescribably changed, perchance much for the worse. In brief, Tarrant had
      gone forth a bachelor, and came back a married man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be sober fact? Had he in very deed committed so gross an
      absurdity?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had purposed no such thing. Miss. Nancy Lord was not by any means the
      kind of person that entered his thoughts when they turned to marriage. He
      regarded her as in every respect his inferior. She belonged to the social
      rank only just above that of wage-earners; her father had a small business
      in Camberwell; she dressed and talked rather above her station, but so,
      now-a-days, did every daughter of petty tradesfolk. From the first he had
      amused himself with her affectation of intellectual superiority. Miss.
      Lord represented a type; to study her as a sample of the pretentious
      half-educated class was interesting; this sort of girl was turned out in
      thousands every year, from so-called High Schools; if they managed to pass
      some examination or other, their conceit grew boundless. Craftily, he had
      tested her knowledge; it seemed all sham. She would marry some hapless
      clerk, and bring him to bankruptcy by the exigencies of her &lsquo;refinement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So had he thought of Nancy till a few months ago. But in the spring-time,
      when his emotions blossomed with the blossoming year, he met the girl
      after a long interval, and saw her with changed eyes. She had something
      more than prettiness; her looks undeniably improved. It seemed, too, that
      she bore herself more gracefully, and even talked with, at times, an
      approximation to the speech of a lady. These admissions signified much in
      a man of Tarrant&rsquo;s social prejudice&mdash;so strong that it exercised an
      appreciable effect upon his every-day morals. He began to muse about Miss.
      Lord, and the upshot of his musing was that, having learnt of her
      departure for Teignmouth, he idly betook himself in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for marriage, he would as soon have contemplated taking to wife a
      barmaid. Between Miss. Lord and the young lady who dispenses refreshment
      there were distinctions, doubtless, but none of the first importance. Then
      arose the question, in what spirit, with what purpose, did he seek her
      intimacy? The answer he simply postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And postponed it very late indeed. Until the choice was no longer between
      making love in idleness, and conscientiously holding aloof; but between
      acting like a frank blackguard, and making the amends of an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s fault, to be sure. He had not credited himself with this power
      of fascination, and certainly not with the violence of passion which
      recklessly pursues indulgence. Still, the girl&rsquo;s fault; she had behaved&mdash;well,
      as a half-educated girl of her class might be expected to behave.
      Ignorance she could not plead; that were preposterous. Utter subjugation
      by first love; that, perhaps; she affirmed it, and possibly with truth; a
      flattering assumption, at all events. But, all said and done, the issue
      had been of her own seeking. Why, then, accuse himself of blackguardly
      conduct, if he had turned a deaf ear to her pleading? Not one word of
      marriage had previously escaped his lips, nor anything that could imply a
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was the awkward and unaccountable fact that he <i>felt</i>
      himself obliged to marry her; that, when he seemed to be preparing
      resistance, downright shame rendered it impossible. Her face&mdash;her
      face when she looked at him and spoke! The truth was, that he had not
      hesitated at all; there was but one course open to him. He gave glances in
      the other direction; he wished to escape; he reviled himself for his
      folly; he saw the difficulties and discontents that lay before him; but
      choice he had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, in that sense of the word which Tarrant respected, could not be said
      to influence him. He had uttered the word; yes, of course he had uttered
      it; as a man will who is goaded by his raging blood. But he was as far as
      ever from loving Nancy Lord. Her beauty, and a certain growing charm in
      her companionship, had lured him on; his habitual idleness, and the
      vagueness of his principles, made him guilty at last of what a moralist
      would call very deliberate rascality. He himself was inclined to see his
      behaviour in that light; yet why had Nancy so smoothed the path of
      temptation?
    </p>
    <p>
      That <i>her</i> love was love indeed, he might take for granted. To a
      certain point, it excused her. But she seemed so thoroughly able to
      protect herself; the time of her green girlhood had so long gone by. For
      explanation, he must fall back again on the circumstances of her origin
      and training. Perhaps she illustrated a social peril, the outcome of
      modern follies. Yes, that was how he would look at it. A result of
      charlatan &lsquo;education&rsquo; operating upon crude character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could say what the girl had been reading, what cheap philosophies had
      unsettled her mind? Is not a little knowledge a dangerous thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far had he progressed in the four and twenty hours which followed his&mdash;or
      Nancy&rsquo;s&mdash;conquest. Meanwhile he had visited the office of the
      registrar, had made his application for a marriage licence, a proceeding
      which did not tend to soothe him. Later, when he saw Nancy again, he
      experienced a revival of that humaner mood which accompanied his pledge to
      marry her, the mood of regret, but also of tenderness, of compassion. A
      tenderness that did not go very deep, a half-slighting compassion. His
      character, and the features of the case, at present allowed no more; but
      he preferred the kindlier attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he preferred it. Was he not essentially good-natured? Would he
      not, at any ordinary season, go out of his way to do a kindness? Did not
      his soul revolt against every form of injustice? Whom had he ever injured?
      For his humanity, no less than for his urbanity, he claimed a noteworthy
      distinction among young men of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there lay the pity of it. But for Nancy&rsquo;s self-abandonment, he might
      have come to love her in good earnest. As it was, the growth of their
      intimacy had been marked with singular, unanticipated impulses on his
      side, impulses quite inconsistent with heartless scheming. In the
      compunctious visitings which interrupted his love-making at least twice,
      there was more than a revolt of mere honesty, as he recognised during his
      brief flight to London. Had she exercised but the common prudence of
      womanhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, that she did not, might tell both for and against her. Granting that
      she lacked true dignity, native refinement, might it not have been
      expected that artfulness would supply their place? Artful fencing would
      have stamped her of coarse nature. But coarseness she had never betrayed;
      he had never judged her worse than intellectually shallow. Her
      self-surrender might, then, indicate a trait worthy of admiration. Her
      subsequent behaviour undeniably pleaded for respect. She acquainted him
      with the circumstances of her home life, very modestly, perhaps
      pathetically. He learnt that her father was not ill to do, heard of her
      domestic and social troubles, that her mother had been long dead, things
      weighing in her favour, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only she had loved him less!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over; he was married. In acting honourably, it seemed probable
      that he had spoilt his life. He must be prepared for anything. Nancy said
      that she should not, could not, tell her father, yet awhile; but that
      resolution was of doubtful stability. For his own part, he thought it
      clearly advisable that the fact should not become known at Champion Hill;
      but could he believe Nancy&rsquo;s assurance that Miss. Morgan remained in the
      dark? Upon one catastrophe, others might naturally follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Saturday at noon, came a letter of Nancy&rsquo;s writing. A long letter,
      and by no means a bad one; superior, in fact, to anything he thought she
      could have written. It moved him somewhat, but would have moved him more,
      had he not been legally bound to the writer. On Sunday she could not come
      to see him; but on Monday, early in the afternoon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there were consolations. A wise man makes the best of the
      inevitable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since his return he had seen no one, and none of his friends knew where he
      had been. A call from some stray Hodiernal would be very unseasonable this
      Monday afternoon; but probably they were all enjoying their elegant
      leisure in regions remote from town. As the hour of Nancy&rsquo;s arrival drew
      near, he sat trying to compose himself&mdash;with indifferent success. At
      one moment his thoughts found utterance, and he murmured in a strange,
      bewildered tone&mdash;&lsquo;My wife.&rsquo; Astonishing words! He laughed at their
      effect upon him, but unmirthfully. And his next murmur was&mdash;&lsquo;The
      devil!&rsquo; A mere ejaculation, betokening his state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached several times for his pipe, and remembered when he had touched
      it that the lips with which he greeted Nancy ought not to be redolent of
      tobacco. In outward respect, at all events, he would not fall short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just when his nervousness was becoming intolerable, there sounded a knock.
      The knock he had anticipated&mdash;timid, brief. He stepped hastily from
      the room, and opened. Nancy hardly looked at him, and neither of them
      spoke till the closing of two doors had assured their privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you had no difficulty in finding the place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;none at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood apart, and spoke with constraint. Nancy&rsquo;s bosom heaved, as
      though she had been hastening overmuch; her face was deeply coloured; her
      eyes had an unwonted appearance, resembling those of a night-watcher at
      weary dawn. She cast quick glances about the room, but with the diffidence
      of an intruder. Her attitude was marked by the same characteristic; she
      seemed to shrink, to be ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and sit down,&rsquo; said Tarrant cheerfully, as he wheeled a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him, and he, stooping beside her, offered his lips. Nancy
      kissed him, closing her eyes for the moment, then dropping them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems a long time, Nancy&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;a very long time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t come on Sunday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found my father very ill. I didn&rsquo;t like to leave home till to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father ill?&mdash;You said nothing of it in your letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like to&mdash;with the other things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular delicacy this; Tarrant understood it, and looked at her
      thoughtfully. Again she was examining the room with hurried glance; upon
      him her eyes did not turn. He asked questions about Mr. Lord. Nancy could
      not explain the nature of his illness; he had spoken of gout, but she
      feared it must be something worse; the change in him since she went away
      was incredible and most alarming. This she said in short, quick sentences,
      her voice low. Tarrant thought to himself that in her too, a very short
      time had made a very notable change; he tried to read its significance,
      but could reach no certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear all this&mdash;very sorry. You must tell me more about
      your father. Take off your hat, dear, and your gloves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gloves she removed first, and laid them on her lap; Tarrant took them
      away. Then her hat; this too he placed on the table. Having done so, he
      softly touched the plaits of her hair. And, for the first time, Nancy
      looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you glad to see me?&rsquo; she asked, in a voice that seemed subdued by
      doubt of the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am&mdash;very glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand fell to her shoulder. With a quick movement, a stifled
      exclamation, the girl rose and flung her arms about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you really glad?&mdash;Do you really love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never doubt it, dear girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but I can&rsquo;t help. I have hardly slept at night, in trying to get rid
      of the doubt. When you opened the door, I felt you didn&rsquo;t welcome me.
      Don&rsquo;t you think of me as a burden? I can&rsquo;t help wondering why I am here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took hold of her left hand, and looked at it, then said playfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you wonder. What business has a wife to come and see her
      husband without the ring on her finger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy turned from him, opened the front of her dress, unknotted a string
      of silk, and showed her finger bright with the golden circlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how I must wear it, except when I am with you. I keep touching&mdash;to
      make sure it&rsquo;s there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant kissed her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear,&rsquo;&mdash;she had her face against him&mdash;&lsquo;make me certain that you
      love me. Speak to me like you did before. Oh, I never knew in my life what
      it was to feel ashamed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ashamed? Because you are married, Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I really married? That seems impossible. It&rsquo;s like having dreamt that
      I was married to you. I can hardly remember a thing that happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The registry at Teignmouth remembers,&rsquo; he answered with a laugh. &lsquo;Those
      books have a long memory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you undo it if you could?&mdash;No, no, I don&rsquo;t mean that.
      Only that if it had never happened&mdash;if we had said good-bye before
      those last days&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you have been glad now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer,&rsquo; he returned gently. &lsquo;It all
      depends on your own feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For whatever reason, these words so overcame Nancy that she burst into
      tears. Tarrant, at once more lover-like, soothed and fondled her, and drew
      her to sit on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not like your old self, dear girl. Of course, I can understand it.
      And your father&rsquo;s illness. But you mustn&rsquo;t think of it in this way. I do
      love you, Nancy. I couldn&rsquo;t unsay a word I said to you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wish
      anything undone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make me believe that. I think I should be quite happy then. It&rsquo;s the
      hateful thought that perhaps you never wanted me for your wife; it <i>will</i>
      come, again and again, and it makes me feel as if I would rather have
      died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send such thoughts packing. Tell them your husband wants all your heart
      and mind for himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But will you never think ill of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered the words, close-clinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be a contemptible sort of brute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I ought to have&mdash;. If we had spoken of our love to each other,
      and waited.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very proper twelvemonth&rsquo;s engagement,&mdash;meetings at five o&rsquo;clock
      tea,&mdash;fifty thousand love-letters,&mdash;and all that kind of thing.
      Oh, we chose a better way. Our wedding was among the leaves and flowers.
      You remember the glow of evening sunlight between the red pine and the
      silver birch? I hope that place may remain as it is all our lives; we will
      go there&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never! Never ask me to go there. I want to forget&mdash;I hope some day I
      may forget.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you hope so, then I will hope the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you love me&mdash;with real, husband&rsquo;s love&mdash;love that will
      last?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should <i>I</i> answer all the questions?&rsquo; He took her face between
      his hands. What if the wife&rsquo;s love should fail first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can say that lightly, because you know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that I am <i>all</i> love of you. As long as I am myself, I must
      love you. It was because I had no will of my own left, because I lived
      only in the thought of you day and night&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their lips met in a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t stay past four o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; were Nancy&rsquo;s next words. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like
      to be away long from the house. Father won&rsquo;t ask me anything, but he knows
      I&rsquo;m away somewhere, and I&rsquo;m afraid it makes him angry with me.&rsquo; She
      examined the room. &lsquo;How comfortable you are here! what a delightful old
      place to live in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you look at the other rooms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to-day&mdash;when I come again. I must say good-bye very soon&mdash;oh,
      see how the time goes! What a large library you have! You must let me look
      at all the books, when I have time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let you? They are yours as much as mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to live here; how I should enjoy it after that hateful
      Grove Lane! Shall I live here with you some day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be room for two. Why, your dresses would fill the whole
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and stood before the shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how dusty you are! Who cleans for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one. A very rickety old woman draws a certain number of shillings each
      week, on pretence of cleaning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a shame! She neglects you disgracefully. You shall go away some
      afternoon, and leave me here with a great pile of dusters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can do that kind of thing? It never occurred to me to ask you: are
      you a domestic person?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered with something of the old confident air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was an oversight, wasn&rsquo;t it? After all, how little you know about
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know much more of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her countenance fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are going to tell me&mdash;everything. How long have you lived here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two years and a half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your friends come to see you here? Of course they do. I meant, have
      you many friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends, no. A good many acquaintances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men, like yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mostly men, fellows who talk about art and literature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And women?&rsquo; Nancy faltered, half turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, magnificent creatures&mdash;Greek scholars&mdash;mathematicians&mdash;all
      that is most advanced!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the right answer to a silly question,&rsquo; said Nancy humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat, Tarrant fixed his gaze upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I begin to think that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself awkwardly. Nancy insisted on the completion of his
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That of all the women I know, you have the most sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had rather hear you say that than have a great fortune.&rsquo; She blushed
      with joy. &lsquo;Perhaps you will love me some day, as I wish to be loved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you another time. If it weren&rsquo;t for my father&rsquo;s illness, I
      think I could go home feeling almost happy. But how am I to know what you
      are doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you wish me to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just tell me how you live. What shall you do now, when I&rsquo;m gone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit disconsolate,&rsquo;&mdash;he came nearer&mdash;&lsquo;thinking you were just a
      little unkind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t say that.&rsquo; Nancy was flurried. &lsquo;I have told you the real
      reason. Our housekeeper says that father was disappointed and angry
      because I put off my return from Teignmouth. He spoke to me very coldly,
      and I have hardly seen him since. He won&rsquo;t let me wait upon him; and I
      have thought, since I know how ill he really is, that I must seem
      heartless. I will come for longer next time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To make amends for the reproach he had uttered in spite of himself,
      Tarrant began to relate in full the events of his ordinary day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I get my own breakfast&mdash;the only meal I have at home. Look, here&rsquo;s
      the kitchen, queer old place. And here&rsquo;s the dining-room. Cupboards
      everywhere, you see; we boast of our cupboards. The green paint is <i>de
      rigueur</i>; duck&rsquo;s egg colour; I&rsquo;ve got to like it. That door leads into
      the bedroom. Well, after breakfast, about eleven o&rsquo;clock that&rsquo;s to say, I
      light up&mdash;look at my pipe-rack&mdash;and read newspapers. Then, if
      it&rsquo;s fine, I walk about the streets, and see what new follies men are
      perpetrating. And then&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He told of his favourite restaurants, of his unfashionable club, of a few
      houses where, at long intervals, he called or dined, of the Hodiernals, of
      a dozen other small matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a life,&rsquo; sighed the listener, &lsquo;compared with mine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll remedy that, some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When?&rsquo; she asked absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait just a little.&mdash;You don&rsquo;t wish to tell your father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t tell him. I doubt whether I shall ever dare to tell him face to
      face.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think about it. Leave it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have letters from you&mdash;but how? Perhaps, if you could promise
      always to send them for the first post&mdash;I generally go to the
      letter-box, and I could do so always&mdash;whilst father is ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was agreed upon. Nancy, whilst they were talking, took her hat from
      the table; at the same moment, Tarrant&rsquo;s hand moved towards it. Their eyes
      met, and the hand that would have checked her was drawn back. Quickly,
      secretly, she drew the ring from her finger, hid it somewhere, and took
      her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you come by the back way?&rsquo; Tarrant asked, when he had bitten his lips
      for a sulky minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, as you told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would walk with her into Chancery Lane; there could be no risk
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall go out first. Any one passing will suppose you had business
      with the solicitor underneath. I&rsquo;ll overtake you at Southampton
      Buildings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatient to be gone, she lingered minute after minute, and broke
      hurriedly from his restraining arms at last. The second outer door, which
      Tarrant had closed on her entrance, surprised her by its prison-like
      massiveness. In the wooden staircase she stopped timidly, but at the exit
      her eyes turned to an inscription above, which she had just glanced at
      when arriving: <i>Surrexit e flammis</i>, and a date. Nancy had no Latin,
      but guessed an interpretation from the last word. Through the little
      court, with its leafy plane-trees and white-worn cobble-stones, she walked
      with bent head, hearing the roar of Holborn through the front archway, and
      breathing more freely when she gained the quiet garden at the back of the
      Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant&rsquo;s step sounded behind her. Looking up she asked the meaning of the
      inscription she had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know Latin? Well, why should you? <i>Surrexit e flammis</i>,
      &ldquo;It rose again from the flames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it might be something like that. You will be patient with my
      ignorance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange word upon Nancy&rsquo;s lips. No mortal ere this had heard her confess
      to ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you know the modern languages?&rsquo; said Tarrant, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. That is, a little French and German&mdash;a very little German.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant mused, seemingly with no dissatisfaction.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      In her brother&rsquo;s looks and speech Nancy detected something mysterious.
      Undoubtedly he was keeping a secret from her, and there could be just as
      little doubt that he would not keep it long. Whenever she questioned him
      about the holiday at Scarborough, he put on a smile unlike any she had
      ever seen on his face, so profoundly thoughtful was it, so loftily
      reserved. On the subject of Mrs. Damerel he did not choose to be very
      communicative; Nancy gathered little more than she had learnt from his
      letter. But very plainly the young man held himself in higher esteem than
      hitherto; very plainly he had learnt to think of &lsquo;the office&rsquo; as a burden
      or degradation, from which he would soon escape. Prompted by her own
      tormenting conscience, his sister wondered whether Fanny French had
      anything to do with the mystery; but this seemed improbable. She mentioned
      Fanny&rsquo;s name one evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see much of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; was the dreamy reply. &lsquo;When are you going to call?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, not at present,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve altered again, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She vouchsafed no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something I think I ought to tell you,&rsquo; said Horace, speaking as
      though he were the elder and felt a responsibility. &lsquo;People have been
      talking about you and Mr. Crewe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; She flashed into excessive anger. &lsquo;Who has been talking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people over there. Of course I know it&rsquo;s all nonsense. At least&rsquo;&mdash;he
      raised his eyebrows&mdash;&lsquo;I suppose it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> should suppose so,&rsquo; said Nancy, with vehement scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their father&rsquo;s illness imposed a restraint upon trifling conversation.
      Mary Woodruff, now attending upon Mr. Lord under the doctor&rsquo;s directions,
      had held grave talk with Nancy. The Barmbys, father and son, called
      frequently, and went away with gloomy faces. Nancy and her brother were
      summoned, separately, to the invalid&rsquo;s room at uncertain times, but
      neither was allowed to perform any service for him; their sympathy, more
      often than not, excited irritation; the sufferer always seemed desirous of
      saying more than the few and insignificant words which actually passed his
      lips, and generally, after a long silence, he gave the young people an
      abrupt dismissal. With his daughter he spoke at length, in language which
      awed her by its solemnity; Nancy could only understand him as meaning that
      his end drew near. He had been reviewing, he said, the course of her life,
      and trying to forecast her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you no more advice; it would only be repeating what I have said
      hundreds of times. All I can <i>do</i> for your good, I have done. You
      will understand me better if you live a few more years, and I think, in
      the end, you will be grateful to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, sitting by the bedside, laid a hand upon her father&rsquo;s and sobbed.
      She entreated him to believe that even now she understood how wisely he
      had guided her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tried to, Nancy; tried to, my dear. Guidance isn&rsquo;t for young people
      now-a-days. Don&rsquo;t let us shirk the truth. I have never been satisfied with
      you, but I have loved you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I you, dear father&mdash;I have! I have!&mdash;I know better now how
      good your advice was. I wish&mdash;far, far more sincerely than you think&mdash;that
      I had kept more control upon myself&mdash;thought less of myself in every
      way&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she spoke through her tears, the yellow, wrinkled face upon the
      pillow, with its sunken eyes and wasted lips, kept sternly motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t mock at me,&rsquo; Stephen pursued, &lsquo;I will show you an example
      you would do well to imitate. It is our old servant, now my kindest,
      truest friend. If I could hope that you will let her be <i>your</i>
      friend, it would help to put my mind at rest. Don&rsquo;t look down upon her,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      such a poor way of thinking. Of all the women I have known, she is the
      best. Don&rsquo;t be too proud to learn from her, Nancy. In all these twenty
      years that she has been in my house, whatever she undertook to do, she did
      well;&mdash;nothing too hard or too humble for her, if she thought it her
      duty. I know what that means; I myself have been a poor, weak creature,
      compared with her. Don&rsquo;t be offended because I ask you to take pattern by
      her. I know her value now better than I ever knew it before. I owe her a
      debt I can&rsquo;t pay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy left the room burdened with strange and distressful thoughts. When
      she saw Mary she looked at her with new feelings, and spoke to her less
      familiarly than of wont. Mary was very silent in these days; her face had
      the dignity of a profound unspoken grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his son, Mr. Lord talked only of practical things, urging sound advice,
      and refraining, now, from any mention of their differences. Horace,
      absorbed in preoccupations, had never dreamt that this illness might prove
      fatal; on finding Nancy in tears, he was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s dangerous?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he will never get well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday morning. The young man went apart and pondered. After the
      mid-day meal, having heard from Mary that his father was no worse, he left
      home without remark to any one, and from Camberwell Green took a cab to
      Trafalgar Square. At the Hotel Metropole he inquired for Mrs. Damerel; her
      rooms were high up, and he ascended by the lift. Sunk in a deep chair, her
      feet extended upon a hassock, Mrs. Damerel was amusing herself with a
      comic paper; she rose briskly, though with the effort of a person who is
      no longer slim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am, you see!&mdash;up in the clouds. Now, <i>did</i> you get my
      letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No letter, but a telegram.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, I thought so. Isn&rsquo;t that just like me? As soon as I had sent out
      the letter to post, I said to myself that I had written the wrong address.
      What address it <i>was</i>, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, to save my life, but I
      shall see when it comes back from the post-office. I rather suspect it&rsquo;s
      gone to Gunnersbury; just then I was thinking about somebody at
      Gunnersbury&mdash;or somebody at Hampstead, I can&rsquo;t be sure which. What a
      good thing I wired!&mdash;Oh, now, Horace, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> like that, I
      don&rsquo;t really!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at her in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What don&rsquo;t you like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that tie. It won&rsquo;t do at all. Your taste is generally very good, but
      that tie! I&rsquo;ll choose one for you to-morrow, and let you have it the next
      time you come. Do you know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that it might be well if
      you parted your hair in the middle. I don&rsquo;t care for it as a rule; but in
      your case, with your soft, beautiful hair, I think it would look well.
      Shall we try? Wait a minute; I&rsquo;ll run for a comb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose some one came&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody will come, my dear boy. Hardly any one knows I&rsquo;m here. I like to
      get away from people now and then; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve taken refuge in this
      cock-loft.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared, and came back with a comb of tortoise-shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down there. Oh, what hair it is, to be sure! Almost as fine as my
      own. I think you&rsquo;ll have a delicious moustache.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her personal appearance was quite in keeping with this vivacity. Rather
      short, and inclining&mdash;but as yet only inclining&mdash;to rotundity of
      figure, with a peculiarly soft and clear complexion, Mrs. Damerel made a
      gallant battle against the hostile years. Her bright eye, her moist lips,
      the admirable smoothness of brow and cheek and throat, bore witness to
      sound health; as did the rows of teeth, incontestably her own, which she
      exhibited in her frequent mirth. A handsome woman still, though not of the
      type that commands a reverent admiration. Her frivolity did not exclude a
      suggestion of shrewdness, nor yet of capacity for emotion, but it was
      difficult to imagine wise or elevated thought behind that narrow brow. She
      was elaborately dressed, with only the most fashionable symbols of
      widowhood; rings adorned her podgy little hand, and a bracelet her white
      wrist. Refinement she possessed only in the society-journal sense, but her
      intonation was that of the idle class, and her grammar did not limp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;let me look. Oh, I think that&rsquo;s an improvement&mdash;more <i>distingue</i>.
      And now tell me the news. How is your father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very bad, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Horace, when he had regarded himself in a
      mirror with something of doubtfulness. &lsquo;Nancy says that she&rsquo;s afraid he
      won&rsquo;t get well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t say that! Oh, how very sad! But let us hope. I can&rsquo;t think
      it&rsquo;s so bad as that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat in thought. Mrs. Damerel, her bright eyes subduing their gaiety
      to a keen reflectiveness, put several questions regarding the invalid,
      then for a moment meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we must hope for the best. Let me know to-morrow how he gets on&mdash;be
      sure you let me know. And if anything <i>should</i> happen&mdash;oh, but
      that&rsquo;s too sad; we won&rsquo;t talk about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she meditated, tapping the floor, and, as it seemed, trying not to
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be downcast, my dear boy. Never meet sorrow half-way&mdash;if you
      knew how useful I have found it to remember that maxim. I have gone
      through sad, sad things&mdash;ah! But now tell me of your own affairs.
      Have you seen <i>la petite</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I just saw her the other evening,&rsquo; he answered uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just? What does that mean, I wonder? Now you don&rsquo;t look anything like so
      well as when you were at Scarborough. You&rsquo;re worrying; yes, I know you
      are. It&rsquo;s your nervous constitution, my poor boy. So you just saw her? No
      more imprudences?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She examined his face attentively, her lips set with tolerable firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very difficult position, you know,&rsquo; said Horace, wriggling in his
      chair. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get out of it all at once. And the truth is, I&rsquo;m not sure
      that I wish to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel drew her eyebrows together, and gave a loud tap on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s weak&mdash;that&rsquo;s very weak! After promising me! Now listen;
      listen seriously.&rsquo; She raised a finger. &lsquo;If it goes on, I have nothing&mdash;more&mdash;whatever
      to do with you. It would distress me very, very much; but I can&rsquo;t interest
      myself in a young man who makes love to a girl so very far beneath him. Be
      led by me, Horace, and your future will be brilliant. Prefer this young
      lady of Camberwell, and lose everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace leaned forward and drooped his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you form anything like a right idea of her,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other moved impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear boy, I know her as well as if I&rsquo;d lived with her for years. Oh,
      how silly you are! But then you are so young, so very young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the vexation on her face there blended, as she looked at him, a
      tenderness unmistakably genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what. I have really no objection to make Fanny&rsquo;s
      acquaintance. Suppose, after all, you bring her to see me one of these
      days. Not just yet. You must wait till I am in the mood for it. But before
      very long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked up with pleasure and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, that&rsquo;s really kind of you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? And all the rest is only pretended kindness? Silly boy! Some day
      you will know better. Now, think, Horace; suppose you were so unhappy as
      to lose your father. Could you, as soon as he was gone, do something that
      you know would have pained him deeply?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pathetic note was a little strained; putting her head aside, Mrs.
      Damerel looked rather like a sentimental picture in an advertisement.
      Horace did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You surely wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; pursued the lady, with emphasis, watching him
      closely; &lsquo;you surely wouldn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t marry this girl as soon as your
      poor father was in his grave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel seemed relieved, but pursued her questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t think of marrying for at least half a year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny wouldn&rsquo;t wish it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, of course not,&mdash;well now, I think I must make her acquaintance.
      But how weak you are, Horace! Oh, those nerves! All finely, delicately
      organised people, like you, make such blunders in life. Your sense of
      honour is such a tyrant over you. Now, mind, I don&rsquo;t say for a moment that
      Fanny isn&rsquo;t fond of you,&mdash;how could she help being, my dear boy? But
      I do insist that she will be very much happier if you let her marry some
      one of her own class. You, Horace, belong to a social sphere so far, far
      above her. If I could only impress that upon your modesty. You are made to
      associate with people of the highest refinement. How deplorable to think
      that a place in society is waiting for you, and you keep longing for
      Camberwell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener&rsquo;s face wavered between pleasure in such flattery and the
      impulse of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember, Horace, if anything <i>should</i> happen at home, you are your
      own master. I could introduce you freely to people of wealth and fashion.
      Of course you could give up the office at once. I shall be taking a house
      in the West-end, or a flat, at all events. I shall entertain a good deal&mdash;and
      think of your opportunities! My dear boy, I assure you that, with personal
      advantages such as yours, you might end by marrying an heiress. Nothing
      more probable! And you can talk of such a girl as Fanny French&mdash;for
      shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t propose any gaieties just now,&rsquo; she said, when they had been
      together for an hour. &lsquo;And I shall wait so anxiously for news of your
      father. If anything <i>did</i> happen, what would your sister do, I
      wonder?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;except that she&rsquo;d get away from Camberwell.
      Nancy hates it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who knows? I may be able to be of use to her. But, you say she is such a
      grave and learned young lady? I am afraid we should bore each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, Horace could venture only an uncertain reply. He had not much
      hope of mutual understanding between his sister and Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five he was home again, and there followed a cheerless
      evening. Nancy was in her own room until nine o&rsquo;clock. She came down for
      supper, but had no appetite; her eyes showed redness from weeping; Horace
      could say nothing for her comfort. After the meal, they went up together
      to the drawing-room, and sat unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we lose father,&rsquo; said Nancy, in a dull voice very unlike her ordinary
      tones, &lsquo;we shall have not a single relative left, that is anything to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Mrs. Damerel,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;ever said anything to you about
      mother&rsquo;s family?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After hesitation, Horace answered, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and his countenance showed that
      the affirmative had special meaning. Nancy waited with an inquiring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;because&mdash;we have had other things to
      think about. But Mrs. Damerel is mother&rsquo;s sister, our aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long have you known that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She told me at Scarborough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why didn&rsquo;t she tell you so at first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t understand. She says she was afraid I might mention
      it; but I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the real reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s questioning elicited all that was to be learnt from her brother,
      little more than she had heard already; the same story of a disagreement
      between Mrs. Damerel and their father, of long absences from England, and
      a revival of interest in her relatives, following upon Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s
      widowhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would be glad to see you, if you liked. But I doubt whether you would
      get on very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care about the same things that you do. She&rsquo;s a woman of
      society, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if she&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister. Yes, I should like to know her.&rsquo; Nancy
      spoke with increasing earnestness. &lsquo;It makes everything quite different. I
      must see her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as I said, she&rsquo;s quite willing. But you remember that I&rsquo;m supposed
      not to have spoken about her at all. I should have to get her to send you
      a message, or something of that kind. Of course, we have often talked
      about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t form an idea of her,&rsquo; said Nancy impatiently. &lsquo;Is she good? Is
      she really kind? Couldn&rsquo;t you get her portrait to show me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be afraid to ask, unless she had given me leave to speak to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She really lives in good society?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you the sort of people she knows? She must be very well
      off; there can&rsquo;t be a doubt of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t care so much about that,&rsquo; said Nancy in a brooding voice. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      herself,&mdash;whether she&rsquo;s kind and good and wishes well to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day there was no change in Mr. Lord&rsquo;s condition; a deep silence
      possessed the house. In the afternoon Nancy went to pass an hour with
      Jessica Morgan; on her return she met Samuel Barmby, who was just leaving
      after a visit to the sick man. Samuel bore himself with portentous
      gravity, but spoke only a few commonplaces, affecting hope; he bestowed
      upon Nancy&rsquo;s hand a fervent pressure, and strode away with the air of an
      undertaker who had called on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more days of deepening gloom, then a night through which Nancy sat
      with Mary Woodruff by her father&rsquo;s bed. Mr. Lord was unconscious, but from
      time to time a syllable or a phrase fell from his lips, meaningless to the
      watchers. At dawn, Nancy went to her chamber, pallid, exhausted. Mary,
      whose strength seemed proof against fatigue, moved about the room,
      preparing for a new day; every few minutes she stood with eyes fixed on
      the dying face, and the tears she had restrained in Nancy&rsquo;s presence
      flowed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sun made a golden glimmer upon the wall, Mary withdrew, and was
      absent for a quarter of an hour. On returning, she bent at once over the
      bed; her eyes were met by a grave, wondering look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lips moved; she bent lower, but could distinguish no word. He was
      speaking; the murmur continued; but she gathered no sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can trust me, I will do all I can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to understand her, and smiled. As the smile faded away, passing
      into an austere calm, Mary pressed her lips upon his forehead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      After breakfast, and before Arthur Peachey&rsquo;s departure for business, there
      had been a scene of violent quarrel between him and his wife. It took
      place in the bed-room, where, as usual save on Sunday morning, Ada
      consumed her strong tea and heavily buttered toast; the state of her
      health&mdash;she had frequent ailments, more or less genuine, such as
      afflict the indolent and brainless type of woman&mdash;made it necessary
      for her to repose till a late hour. Peachey did not often lose
      self-control, though sorely tried; the one occasion that unchained his
      wrath was when Ada&rsquo;s heedlessness or ill-temper affected the well-being of
      his child. This morning it had been announced to him that the nurse-girl,
      Emma, could no longer be tolerated; she was making herself offensive to
      her mistress, had spoken insolently, disobeyed orders, and worst of all,
      defended herself by alleging orders from Mr. Peachey. Hence the outbreak
      of strife, signalled by furious shrill voices, audible to Beatrice and
      Fanny as they sat in the room beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada came down at half-past ten, and found Beatrice writing letters. She
      announced what any who did not know her would have taken for a final
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going&mdash;I won&rsquo;t put up with that beast any longer. I shall go and
      live at Brighton.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister paid not the slightest heed; she was intent upon a business
      letter of much moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear what I say? I&rsquo;m going by the first train this afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; remarked Beatrice placidly. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this was fury directed against Beatrice, who found herself
      accused of every domestic vice compatible with her position. She was a
      sordid creature, living at other people&rsquo;s expense,&mdash;a selfish,
      scheming, envious wretch&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were your husband,&rsquo; remarked the other without looking up, &lsquo;I should
      long since have turned you into the street&mdash;if I hadn&rsquo;t broken your
      neck first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercise in quarrel only made Ada&rsquo;s voice the clearer and more shrill. It
      rose now to the highest points of a not inconsiderable compass. But
      Beatrice continued to write, and by resolute silence put a limit to her
      sister&rsquo;s railing. A pause had just come about, when the door was thrown
      open, and in rushed Fanny, hatted and gloved from a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; she said excitedly. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice turned with a look of interest. &lsquo;Who? Mr. Lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. The blinds are all down. He must have died in the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled, as though she had brought the
      most exhilarating news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I care?&rsquo; said Mrs. Peachey, to whom her sister had addressed the
      last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as much as I care about your affairs, no doubt,&rsquo; returned Fanny,
      with genial frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be in too great a hurry,&rsquo; remarked Beatrice, who showed the
      calculating wrinkle at the corner of her eye. &lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s dead, that
      doesn&rsquo;t say that your masher comes in for money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;ll get it, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be nothing worth speaking of to get, for all we know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice had not as yet gained Fanny&rsquo;s co-operation in the commercial
      scheme now being elaborated; though of far more amiable nature than Mrs.
      Peachey, she heartily hoped that the girl might be disappointed in her
      expectations from Mr. Lord&rsquo;s will. An hour later, she walked along Grove
      Lane, and saw for herself that Fanny&rsquo;s announcement was accurate; the
      close-drawn blinds could mean but one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day there was little likelihood of learning particulars, but on the
      morrow Fanny might perchance hear something from Horace Lord. However, the
      evening brought a note, hand-delivered by some stranger. Horace wrote only
      a line or two, informing Fanny that his father had died about eight
      o&rsquo;clock that morning, and adding: &lsquo;Please be at home to-morrow at twelve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve next day Fanny received her lover alone in the drawing-room. He
      entered with the exaggerated solemnity of a very young man who knows for
      the first time a grave bereavement, and feels the momentary importance it
      confers upon him. Fanny, trying to regard him without a smile, grimaced;
      decorous behaviour was at all times impossible to her, for she neither
      understood its nature nor felt its obligation. In a few minutes she smiled
      unrestrainedly, and spoke the things that rose to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping a secret from you,&rsquo; said Horace, in the low voice which
      had to express his sorrow,&mdash;for he could not preserve a gloomy
      countenance with Fanny before him. &lsquo;But I can tell you now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A secret? And what business had you to keep secrets from me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s about Mrs. Damerel. When I was at the seaside she told me who she
      really is. She&rsquo;s my aunt&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s sister. Queer, isn&rsquo;t it? Of
      course that makes everything different. And she&rsquo;s going to ask you to come
      and see her. It&rsquo;ll have to be put off a little&mdash;now; but not very
      long, I dare say, as she&rsquo;s a relative. You&rsquo;ll have to do your best to
      please her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t put myself out of the way. People must take me as they
      find me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t talk like that, Fanny. It isn&rsquo;t very kind&mdash;just now. I
      thought you&rsquo;d be different to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right.&mdash;Have you anything else to tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace understood her significant glance, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know everything as soon as I know myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learnt the day and hour of Mr. Lord&rsquo;s funeral, Ada and Fanny made a
      point of walking out to get a glimpse of it. The procession of vehicles in
      Grove Lane excited their contempt, so far was it from the splendour they
      had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are!&rsquo; said Ada; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it&rsquo;s going to be a jolly
      good take in for you, after all. If he&rsquo;d died worth much, they wouldn&rsquo;t
      have buried him like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s heart sank. She could conceive no other explanation of a simple
      burial save lack of means, or resentment in the survivors at the
      disposition made of his property by the deceased. When, on the morrow,
      Horace told her that his father had strictly charged Mr Barmby to have him
      buried in the simplest mode compatible with decency, she put it down to
      the old man&rsquo;s excessive meanness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion she learnt the contents of Mr. Lord&rsquo;s will, and having
      learnt them, got rid of Horace as soon as possible that she might astonish
      her sisters with the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon of that day, Beatrice had an appointment with Luckworth
      Crewe. She was to meet him at the office he had just taken in Farringdon
      Street, whence they would repair to a solicitor&rsquo;s in the same
      neighbourhood, for the discussion of legal business connected with Miss.
      French&rsquo;s enterprise. She climbed the staircase of a big building, and was
      directed to the right door by the sound of Crewe&rsquo;s voice, loudly and
      jocularly discoursing. He stood with two men in the open doorway, and at
      the sight of Beatrice waved a hand to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take your hook, you fellows; I have an engagement.&rsquo; The men, glancing at
      Miss. French facetiously, went their way. &lsquo;How do, old chum? It&rsquo;s all in a
      mess yet; hold your skirts together. Come along this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through glue-pots and shavings and an overpowering smell of paint,
      Beatrice followed to inspect the premises, which consisted of three rooms;
      one, very much the smallest, about ten feet square. Three workmen were
      busy, and one, fitting up shelves, whistled a melody with ear-piercing
      shrillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop that damned noise!&rsquo; shouted Crewe. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you once already. Try
      it on again, my lad, and I&rsquo;ll drop you down the well of the staircase&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      too much breath, you have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other workmen laughed. It was evident that Crewe had made friends with
      them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t be bad, when we get the decks cleared,&rsquo; he remarked to Beatrice.
      &lsquo;Plenty of room to make twenty thousand a year or so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself, and asked in a subdued voice, &lsquo;Seen anything of the
      Lords?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice nodded with a smile. &lsquo;And heard about the will. Have you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. Come into this little room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door behind them, and looked at his companion with
      curiosity, but without show of eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a joke,&rsquo; said Miss. French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it? How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo;s that mad about it! She&rsquo;d got it into her silly noddle that Horace
      Lord would drop in for a fortune at once. As it is, he gets nothing at all
      for two years, except what the Barmbys choose to give him. And if he
      marries before he&rsquo;s four-and-twenty, he loses everything&mdash;every
      cent!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe whistled a bar of a street-melody, then burst into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how the old joker has done them, is it? Quite right too. The lad
      doesn&rsquo;t know his own mind yet. Let Fanny wait if she really wants him&mdash;and
      if she can keep hold of him. But what are the figures?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing startling. Of course I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and outs of it, but
      Horace Lord will get seven thousand pounds, and a sixth share in the piano
      business. Old Barmby and his son are trustees. They may let Horace have
      just what they think fit during the next two years. If he wants money to
      go into business with, they may advance what they like. But for two years
      he&rsquo;s simply in their hands, to be looked after. And if he marries&mdash;pop
      goes the weasel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Miss. Lord?&rsquo; asked Crewe carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice pointed a finger at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to know badly, don&rsquo;t you? Well, it&rsquo;s pretty much the same as the
      other. To begin with, if she marries before the age of six-and-twenty, she
      gets nothing whatever. If she doesn&rsquo;t marry, there&rsquo;s two hundred a year to
      live on and to keep up the house.&mdash;Oh, I was forgetting; she must not
      only keep single to twenty-six, but continue to live where she does now,
      with that old servant of theirs for companion. At six-and-twenty she takes
      the same as her brother, about seven thousand, and a sixth share in Lord
      and Barmby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Crewe whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s about three years still to live in Grove Lane,&rsquo; he said
      thoughtfully. &lsquo;Well, the old joker has pinned them, and no mistake. I
      thought he had more to leave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you did,&rsquo; remarked Beatrice significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, old fellow, don&rsquo;t talk to me like that,&rsquo; he replied
      good-humouredly, but with a reproof not to be mistaken. &lsquo;I thought nothing
      about it in the way that <i>you</i> mean. But it isn&rsquo;t much, after living
      as he has done. I suppose you don&rsquo;t know how the money lies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have it all from Fanny, and it&rsquo;s a wonder she remembered as much as she
      did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Fanny&rsquo;s pretty smart in L. s. d. But did she say what becomes of the
      money if either of them break the terms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goes to a girl&rsquo;s orphanage, somewhere in the old man&rsquo;s country. But
      there&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;ve accounted for yet. Young Barmby&rsquo;s sisters get
      legacies&mdash;a hundred and fifty apiece. And, last of all, the old
      servant has an annuity of two hundred. He made her a sort of housekeeper
      not long ago, H. L. says; thought no end of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know anything about her,&rsquo; said Crewe absently. &lsquo;I should like to
      know the business details. What arrangement was made, I wonder, when he
      took Barmby into partnership?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he simply gave him a share. Old Barmby and
      Lord were great chums. Then, you see, Samuel Barmby has a third of his
      profits to pay over, eventually.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice went on to speak of the mysterious Mrs. Damerel, concerning whom
      she had heard from Fanny. The man of business gave particular ear to this
      story, and asked many questions. Of a sudden, as if dismissing matters
      which hardly concerned him, he said mirthfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about the row at Lillie Bridge yesterday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw something about it in the paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I was there. Pure chance; haven&rsquo;t been at that kind of place for a
      year and more. It was a match for the Sprint Championship and a hundred
      pounds. Timed for six o&rsquo;clock, but at a quarter past the chaps hadn&rsquo;t come
      forward. I heard men talking, and guessed there was something wrong; they
      thought it a put-up job. When it got round that there&rsquo;d be no race, the
      excitement broke out, and then&mdash;I&rsquo;d have given something for you to
      see it! First of all there was a rush for the gate-money; a shilling a
      piece, you know, we&rsquo;d all paid. There were a whole lot of North-of-England
      chaps, fellow countrymen of mine, and I heard some of them begin to send
      up a roar that sounded dangerous. I was tumbling along with the crowd,
      quite ready for a scrimmage&mdash;I rather enjoy a fight now and then,&mdash;and
      all at once some chap sang out just in front, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s burst up the blooming
      show!&rsquo;&mdash;only he used a stronger word. And a lot of us yelled hooray,
      and to it we went. I don&rsquo;t mean I had a hand in the pillaging and
      smashing,&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t have done for a man just starting in business
      to be up at the police-court,&mdash;but I looked on and laughed&mdash;laughed
      till I could hardly stand! They set to work on the refreshment place. It
      was a scene if you like! Fellows knocking off the heads of bottles, and
      drinking all they could, then pouring the rest on the ground. Glasses and
      decanters flying right and left,&mdash;sandwiches and buns, and I don&rsquo;t
      know what, pelting about. They splintered all the small wood they could
      lay their hands on, and set fire to it, and before you could say Jack
      Robinson the whole place was blazing. The bobbies got it pretty warm&mdash;bottles
      and stones and logs of wood; I saw one poor chap with the side of his face
      cut clean open. It does one good, a real stirring-up like that; I feel
      better to-day than for the last month. And the swearing that went on! It&rsquo;s
      a long time since I heard such downright, hearty, solid swearing. There
      was one chap I kept near, and he swore for a full hour without stopping,
      except when he had a bottle at his mouth; he only stopped when he was
      speechless with liquor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I&rsquo;d been there,&rsquo; said Miss. French gaily. &lsquo;It must have been no
      end of fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A right down good spree. And it wasn&rsquo;t over till about eight o&rsquo;clock. I
      stayed till the police had cleared the grounds, and then came home,
      laughing all the way. It did me good, I tell you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, shall we go and see the lawyer?&rsquo; suggested Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right you are.&mdash;Have a drink first? Nice quiet place round in Fleet
      Street&mdash;glass of wine. No? As you please, old chum.&mdash;Think this
      shop &lsquo;ll do, don&rsquo;t you? You must come round when it&rsquo;s finished. But I
      daresay you&rsquo;ll be here many a time&mdash;on biz.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I daresay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they went down the stairs, Crewe laughed again at his recollections
      of yesterday&rsquo;s sport.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gusts of an October evening swept about the square of the old Inn, and
      made rushes at the windows; all the more cosy seemed it here in Tarrant&rsquo;s
      room, where a big fire, fed into smokeless placidity, purred and crackled.
      Pipe in mouth, Tarrant lay back in his big chair, gracefully indolent as
      ever. Opposite him, lamp-light illuminating her face on one side, and
      fire-gloom on the other, Nancy turned over an illustrated volume, her
      husband&rsquo;s gift today. Many were the presents he had bestowed upon her,
      costly some of them, all flattering the recipient by a presumption of
      taste and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been here since early in the afternoon, it was now near seven
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked at the pictures, but inattentively, her brows slightly
      knitted, and her lips often on the point of speech that concerned some
      other matter. Since the summer holiday she had grown a trifle thinner in
      face; her beauty was no longer allied with perfect health; a heaviness
      appeared on her eyelids. Of course she wore the garb of mourning, and its
      effect was to emphasise the maturing change manifest in her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several minutes there had passed no word; but Tarrant&rsquo;s face, no less
      than his companion&rsquo;s, signalled discussion in suspense. No unfriendly
      discussion, yet one that excited emotional activity in both of them. The
      young man, his pipe-hand falling to his knee, first broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I look at it in this way. We ought to regard ourselves as married people
      living under exceptionally favourable circumstances. One has to bear in
      mind the brutal fact that man and wife, as a rule, see a great deal too
      much of each other&mdash;thence most of the ills of married life:
      squabblings, discontents, small or great disgusts, leading often enough to
      <i>altri guai</i>. People get to think themselves victims of
      incompatibility, when they are merely suffering from a foolish custom&mdash;the
      habit of being perpetually together. In fact, it&rsquo;s an immoral custom. What
      does immorality mean but anything that tends to kill love, to harden
      hearts? The common practice of man and wife occupying the same room is
      monstrous, gross; it&rsquo;s astounding that women of any sensitiveness endure
      it. In fact, their sensitiveness is destroyed. Even an ordinary honeymoon
      generally ends in quarrel&mdash;as it certainly ought to. You and I escape
      all that. Each of us lives a separate life, with the result that we like
      each other better as time goes on; I speak for myself, at all events. I
      look forward to our meetings. I open the door to you with as fresh a
      feeling of pleasure as when you came first. If we had been ceaselessly
      together day and night&mdash;well, you know the result as well as I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with indulgent gravity, in the tone of kindness to which his
      voice was naturally attuned. And Nancy&rsquo;s reply, though it expressed a
      stronger feeling, struck the same harmonious note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can agree with all that. But it applies to people married in the
      ordinary way. I was speaking of ourselves, placed as we are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to like the concealment,&rsquo; said Tarrant. &lsquo;For one thing,
      there&rsquo;s a suggestion of dishonour about it. We&rsquo;ve gone over all that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that for a moment. It isn&rsquo;t really dishonourable. My
      father could never have objected to <i>you</i> for my husband. He only
      wanted to guard me&mdash;Mary says so, and he told her everything. He
      thought me a silly, flighty girl, and was afraid I should be trapped for
      the sake of my money. I wish&mdash;oh how I wish I had had the courage to
      tell him! He would have seen you, and liked and trusted you&mdash;how
      could he help?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might have been better&mdash;but who knows whether he would have seen
      me with your eyes, Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes. But I was going to say&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are so many difficulties before us, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if we continue to think of each other as we do now. Do you mean it
      might be discovered?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, through no fault of ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite sure you haven&rsquo;t told anybody?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant had a doubt on this point. He strongly suspected that Jessica
      Morgan knew the truth, but he shrank from pressing Nancy to an avowal of
      repeated falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s very unlikely we should be found out. Who would dream of
      tracking you here, for instance? And suppose we were seen together in the
      street or in the country, who would suspect anything more than
      love-making? and that is not forbidden you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. But&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, crossed to him, seated herself on his knee and put an arm about
      his neck. Before she had spoken another word, Tarrant understood; the
      smile on his face lost its spontaneity; a bitter taste seemed to distort
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think&mdash;you are afraid&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a monosyllable, and sat silent. This indeed had not entered into
      his calculations; but why not? He could hardly say; he had ignored the not
      unimportant detail, as it lurked among possibilities. Perhaps had
      willingly ignored it, as introducing a complication oppressive to his
      indolence, to his hodiernal philosophy. And now he arraigned
      mother-nature, the very divinity whom hitherto he had called upon to
      justify him. All at once he grew cold to Nancy. The lulled objections to
      matrimony awoke in him again; again he felt that he had made a fool of
      himself. Nancy was better than he had thought; he either loved her, or
      felt something towards her, not easily distinguishable from love. His
      inferior she remained, but not in the sense he had formerly attributed to
      the word. Her mind and heart excelled the idle conception he had formed of
      them. But Nancy was not his wife, as the world understands that relation;
      merely his mistress, and as a mistress he found her charming, lovable.
      What she now hinted at, would shatter the situation. Tarrant thought not
      of the peril to her material prospects; on that score he was indifferent,
      save in so far as Mr Lord&rsquo;s will helped to maintain their mutual
      independence. But he feared for his liberty, in the first place, and in
      the second, abhorred the change that must come over Nancy herself. Nancy a
      mother&mdash;he repelled the image, as though it degraded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delicacy, however, constrained him to a disguise of these emotions. He
      recognised the human sentiments that should have weighed with him; like a
      man of cultivated intelligence, he admitted their force, their beauty.
      None the less, a syllable on Nancy&rsquo;s lips had arrested the current of his
      feelings, and made him wish again that he had been either more or less a
      man of honour down at Teignmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;could I have resisted an appeal for
      marriage <i>now</i>? That comes of being so confoundedly humane. It&rsquo;s a
      marvel that I didn&rsquo;t find myself married to some sheer demirep long ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will it make you love me less?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have always refused to prophesy about love,&rsquo; he answered, with forced
      playfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should find ourselves in a very awkward position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Nancy hurriedly. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see what would be done. But you
      seem colder to me all at once, Lionel. Surely it oughtn&rsquo;t to&mdash;to turn
      you away from me. Perhaps I am mistaken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This referred to the alarming possibility, and Tarrant caught at hope.
      Yes, she might be mistaken; they wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it; he shook it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me fill my pipe again. Yes, you can do it for me. That reminds me of
      a story Harvey Munden tells. A man he knew, a doctor, got married, and
      there was nothing his wife wouldn&rsquo;t do for him. As he sat with her one
      evening, smoking, a patient called him into the consulting-room. He had
      only just lighted a fresh pipe, and laid it down regretfully. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep
      it in for you,&rsquo; said his wife. And she did so, with dainty and fearful
      puffs, at long intervals. But the doctor was detained, and when he came
      back&mdash;well, the poor wife had succumbed to her devotion. She never
      kept in his pipe again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy tried to laugh. She was in her own chair again, and sat resting her
      cheek upon her hand, gazing at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it, Lionel, that no one ever knocks at your door when I&rsquo;m here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very simple. I sport the oak&mdash;as you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you think some friend of yours might see a light in your
      window, and come up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If so, <i>il respecte la consigne</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t like you when you begin to use French words. I think it
      reminds me of once when you did it a long time ago,&mdash;and I thought
      you&mdash;never mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weren&rsquo;t they strange&mdash;those meetings of ours at Champion Hill? What
      did you think me? Arrogant? Insolent? That is my tendency with strangers,
      I admit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I was asking you a question,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;You mean that no one would
      knock, if he saw your outer door closed. But what would they think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt&mdash;that I was working. I am supposed to be secretly engaged
      on some immortal composition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hope no one that knows you will ever see me coming or going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What could it matter? They wouldn&rsquo;t know who you were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But to have such things thought. I should feel it just as if they knew
      me. I believe I could never come again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rsquo; Tarrant asked. &lsquo;You have tears in your
      eyes. You&rsquo;re not well to-day.&rsquo; He checked himself on an unwelcome thought,
      and proceeded more carelessly. &lsquo;Do you suppose for a moment that any
      friend of mine is ass enough to think with condemnation of a girl who
      should come to my rooms&mdash;whatever the circumstances? You must get rid
      of that provincialism&mdash;let us call it Camberwellism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t think it any harm&mdash;even if&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl, we have outgrown those ancestral prejudices.&rsquo; Tarrant&rsquo;s
      humour never quite deserted him, least of all when he echoed the talk of
      his world; but his listener kept a grave face. &lsquo;We have nothing to do with
      Mrs. Grundy&rsquo;s morals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you believe in a morality of some kind?&rsquo; she pursued with diffidence.
      &lsquo;You used the word &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy felt no consciousness of the gulf that yawned between herself as she
      spoke now and the old self which had claimed &lsquo;superiority.&rsquo; Her mind was
      so completely unsettled that she never tried to connect its present state
      with its earlier phases. For the most part, her sensations and her
      reflections were concerned with the crude elements of life; the
      exceptional moments she spent in a world of vague joys and fears, wherein
      thought, properly speaking, had no share. Before she could outlive the
      shock of passion which seemed at once to destroy and to re-create her, she
      was confronted with the second supreme crisis of woman&rsquo;s existence,&mdash;its
      natural effects complicated with the trials of her peculiar position.
      Tarrant&rsquo;s reception of her disclosure came as a new disturbance&mdash;she
      felt bewildered and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, preoccupied with the anxiety he affected to dismiss, had no
      inclination to debate ethical problems. For a while he talked jestingly,
      and at length fell into a mood of silence. Nancy did not stay much longer;
      they parted without mention of the subject uppermost in their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no stated times of meeting. Tarrant sent an invitation whenever
      it pleased him. When the next arrived, in about a week, Nancy made reply
      that she did not feel well enough to leave home. It was the briefest
      letter Tarrant had yet received from her, and the least affectionate. He
      kept silence for a few days, and wrote again. This time Nancy responded as
      usual, and came.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the involuntary question in his eyes, hers answered unmistakably. For
      the first few minutes they said very little to each other. Tarrant was
      struggling with repulsions and solicitudes of which he felt more than half
      ashamed; Nancy, reticent for many reasons, not the least of them a
      resentful pride, which for the moment overcame her fondness, endeavoured
      to speak of trivial things. They kept apart, and at length the
      embarrassment of the situation held them both mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a nervous movement, the young man pushed forward the chair on which
      Nancy usually sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see that you don&rsquo;t look well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy turned to the window. She had unbuttoned her jacket, and taken off
      her gloves, but went no further in the process of preparing herself for
      the ordinary stay of some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did something in my letter displease you?&rsquo; inquired her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean&mdash;because I didn&rsquo;t come? No; I really didn&rsquo;t feel well
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant hesitated, but the softer feeling prevailed with him. He helped to
      remove her jacket, seated her by the fire, and led her to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So there&rsquo;s no doubt of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silence made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then of course there&rsquo;s just as little doubt as to what we must do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had not a convincing sincerity; he waited for the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that we can&rsquo;t keep the secret?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it possible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are vexed about it. You don&rsquo;t speak to me as you used to. I don&rsquo;t
      think you ever will again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will make no change in <i>me</i>,&rsquo; said Tarrant, with resolute good
      humour. &lsquo;All I want to be sure of is that you are quite prepared for the
      change in your prospects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are <i>you</i>, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone and look deprived the inquiry of unpleasant implication. He
      answered her with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know exactly how I regard it. In one way I should feel relief. Of
      course I don&rsquo;t like the thought that I shall have caused you to suffer
      such a loss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should never have that thought. But are you quite sure about the result
      to yourself? You remember saying that you couldn&rsquo;t be certain how&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How it will be taken at Champion Hill? I was going to tell you the latest
      report from there. It is very doubtful whether I should ever have to break
      the news.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not look at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything, in that quarter, must be long since settled. Pray remember
      that I have no vast expectations. Quite certainly, it won&rsquo;t be a large
      fortune; very likely not more than your own. But enough to live on, no
      doubt. I know the value of money&mdash;no man better. It would be pleasant
      enough to play with thousands a year. But I don&rsquo;t grumble so long as I
      have a competency.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy meditated, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a pity. Father never meant me to be penniless if I married
      wisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They both meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible&mdash;would it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he answered with a laugh, &lsquo;last time you were here you spoke in
      quite the other way. You were utterly miserable at the thought of living
      through it alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether I could&mdash;even if&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking with Mary,&rsquo; she replied, after an uneasy pause. &lsquo;She
      has lived with us so long; and since father&rsquo;s death it seems quite natural
      to make a friend of her. No one could be more devoted to me than she is. I
      believe there&rsquo;s nothing she wouldn&rsquo;t do. I believe I might trust her with
      any secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The obvious suggestion demanded thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-bye,&rsquo; said Tarrant, looking up, &lsquo;have you seen your aunt again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s face changed to a cold expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. And I don&rsquo;t think I shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably you were as little sympathetic to her as she to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like her,&rsquo; was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had curious thoughts about that lady,&rsquo; said Tarrant, smiling. &lsquo;The
      mystery, it seems to me, is by no means solved. You think she really <i>is</i>
      your aunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible to doubt it. Any one could see her likeness to Horace at
      once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you didn&rsquo;t mention that. I had a fear that she might be simply an
      adventuress, with an eye to your brother&rsquo;s money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is what she says, I&rsquo;m sure. But I shall never ask her to come and see
      me again, and I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll want to. That would be fortunate if&mdash;if
      we wished&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant nodded. At the same moment they heard a sound that startled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a knock at the door,&rsquo; said Nancy, rising as if to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is. Banging with a stick. Let him bang. It must be a stranger, or
      he&rsquo;d respect the oak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat listening. The knock sounded again, loud and prolonged. Tarrant
      joked about it; but a third time came the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may as well go and see who it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;you won&rsquo;t let any one&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not. Sit quietly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, closing the room-door behind him, and opened the heavy door
      which should have ensured his privacy. For five minutes he was absent,
      then returned with a face portending news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Vawdrey. He knew my habit of sporting the oak, and wouldn&rsquo;t go
      away till he had made sure. My grandmother is dying. They telegraphed to
      Vawdrey in the City, and he came here at once to tell me. I must go.
      Perhaps I shall be too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did he think of your keeping him outside?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I made some sort of excuse. He&rsquo;s a good-natured fellow; it didn&rsquo;t matter.
      Stay a little after I&rsquo;m gone; stay as long as you like, In fact. You can
      pull to the inner door when you go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did the telegram say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Tarrant sinking. Come immediately.&rsquo; Of course we expected it. It&rsquo;s
      raining hard: wait and see if it stops; you must take care of yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this, Nancy was not slow in exhibiting her gratitude, which served as
      mask of the pleasure she could not decently betray. When her husband had
      hastened off, she sat for a few minutes in thought; then, alone here for
      the first time, she began to walk about the rooms, and to make herself
      more intimately acquainted with their contents.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whilst she was thus occupied, darkness came on. She did not care to light
      the lamp, so made herself ready, and stole forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had ceased. Walking alone at night was a pleasure in which she
      now indulged herself pretty frequently; at such times Mary Woodruff
      believed her in the company of Miss. Morgan. The marked sobriety of her
      demeanour since Mr. Lord&rsquo;s death, and the friendliness, even the
      affection, she evinced in their common life at home, had set Mary&rsquo;s mind
      at ease concerning her. No murmur at her father&rsquo;s will had escaped Nancy,
      in this respect very unlike her brother, who, when grief was forgotten,
      declared himself ill-used; she seemed perfectly content with the
      conditions laid upon her, and the sincerity of her mourning could not be
      doubted. Anxious to conciliate the girl in every honest way, Mary behaved
      to her with the same external respect as ever, and without a hint of
      express guardianship. The two were on excellent terms. It seemed likely
      that before long they would have the house to themselves; already Horace
      had spoken of taking lodgings in a part of London more congruous with the
      social aspirations encouraged by his aunt, Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Chancery Lane she passed into Fleet Street, and sauntered along with
      observation of shop-windows. She was unspeakably relieved by the events of
      the afternoon; it would now depend upon her own choice whether she
      preserved her secret, or declared herself a married woman. Her husband had
      proved himself generous as well as loving; yes, she repeated to herself,
      generous and loving; her fears and suspicions had been baseless. Mrs.
      Tarrant&rsquo;s death freed them from all sordid considerations. A short time,
      perhaps a day or two, might put an end to irregularities, and enable her
      to hold up her head once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling hungry, she entered a restaurant, and dined. Not carelessly, but
      with fastidious choice of viands. This was enjoyable; she began to look
      more like herself of a few months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would return to Camberwell by train from Ludgate Hill. At the circus,
      crowding traffic held her back for a minute or two; just as she ran
      forward, a familiar voice caused her to stop again. She became flurried,
      lost her head, stood still amid a tumult of omnibuses, cabs and carts; but
      a hand grasped her by the arm, and led her safely to the opposite
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by shouting at me in the street?&rsquo; were her first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed was Luckworth Crewe; he had by no means anticipated
      such wrathful greeting, and stood in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Miss. Lord. I didn&rsquo;t think I shouted. I only meant to
      call your attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you call my attention?&rsquo; Her cheeks were flushed with anger;
      she regarded him as though he were a stranger guilty of mere insolence. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t wish to speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With astonishment, Crewe found himself alone. But a rebuff such as this,
      so irrational as he thought it, so entirely out of keeping with Miss.
      Lord&rsquo;s behaviour, he could by no means accept. Nancy was walking towards
      the railway-station; he followed. He watched her as she took a ticket,
      then put himself in her way, with all the humility of countenance he could
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I offended you. It wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to do; I ought to
      have waited till you were across. I&rsquo;m a blundering sort of fellow in those
      things. Do let me beg your pardon, and forgive me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was calmer now, though still tremulous. But for the attack of
      nervousness, she would have met Crewe with nothing worse than a slight
      reserve, to mark a change in their relations. Very soon after her father&rsquo;s
      death he had written a becoming letter, though it smacked of commercial
      phraseology. To the hope expressed in it, that he might be allowed to call
      upon her in a few weeks&rsquo; time, Nancy made no reply. A fortnight later he
      wrote again, this time reminding her, with modest propriety, of what had
      occurred between them before she left town in August. Nancy responded, and
      in grave, friendly language, begged him to think of her no more; he must
      not base the slightest hope upon anything she might have said. To her
      surprise, Crewe held his peace, and she saw him now for the first time
      since their ascent of the Monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed that I lost my temper, Mr. Crewe. I am in a hurry to get
      home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the booking-office at Ludgate Hill it is not easy to detain, by
      chivalrous discourse, a lady bent on escaping; but Crewe attempted it. He
      subdued his voice, spoke rapidly and with emotion, implored that he might
      be heard for a moment. Would she not permit him to call upon her? He had
      waited, respecting her seclusion. He asked for nothing whatever but
      permission to call, as any acquaintance might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard I have opened an office in Farringdon Street? I should so
      like to tell you all about it&mdash;what I&rsquo;m doing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one calls to see me,&rsquo; said Nancy, with firmness. &lsquo;I wish to live quite
      alone. I&rsquo;m very sorry to seem unfriendly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it anything I&rsquo;ve done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;nothing whatever. I assure you, nothing. Let us say good-bye; I
      can&rsquo;t stop another moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and so parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re back early,&rsquo; said Mary, when Nancy entered the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I left Jessica to her books sooner than usual. The examination draws
      near.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Quiet, sad, diligent ever, Mary kept unchanged the old domestic routine.
      There was the same perfect order, the same wholesome economy, as when she
      worked under the master&rsquo;s eyes. Nancy had nothing to do but enjoy the
      admirable care with which she was surrounded; she took it all as a matter
      of course, never having considered the difference between her own home and
      those of her acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace had dined, and was gone out again. They talked of him; Mary said
      that he had spoken of moving into lodgings very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course he doesn&rsquo;t tell us everything,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;I feel pretty sure
      that he&rsquo;s going to leave the office, but how he means to live I don&rsquo;t
      understand. Perhaps Mrs. Damerel will give him money, or lend it him. I
      only hope she may break it off between him and Fanny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he told you that Fanny is often with Mrs. Damerel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With her?&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed. &lsquo;He never said a word of it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said so to me this evening, and laughed when I looked surprised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand what&rsquo;s going on. We can&rsquo;t do
      anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o&rsquo;clock the servant entered the room, bringing Miss. Lord a
      note, which had just been left by a cab-driver. Nancy, seeing that the
      address was in Tarrant&rsquo;s hand, opened it with a flutter of joy; such a
      proceeding as this, openly sending a note by a messenger, could only mean
      that her husband no longer cared to preserve secrecy. To her astonishment,
      the envelope contained but a hurried line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word yet to any one. Without fail, come to-morrow afternoon, at
      four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With what show of calmness she could command, she looked up at her
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The idea of his sending in this way! It&rsquo;s that Mr. Crewe I&rsquo;ve told you
      of. I met him as I was coming home, and had to speak to him rather sharply
      to get rid of him. Here comes his apology, foolish man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Living in perpetual falsehood, Nancy felt no shame at a fiction such as
      this. Mere truth-telling had never seemed to her a weighty matter of the
      law. And she was now grown expert in lies. But Tarrant&rsquo;s message disturbed
      her gravely. Something unforeseen must have happened&mdash;something,
      perhaps, calamitous. She passed a miserable night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she ascended the stairs at Staple Inn, next afternoon, it wanted ten
      minutes to four. As usual at her coming, the outer door stood open,
      exposing the door with the knocker. She had just raised her hand, when,
      with a sound of voices from inside, the door opened, and Tarrant appeared
      in company with a stranger. Terror-stricken, she stepped back. Tarrant,
      after a glance, paid no attention to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he was saying to his friend, &lsquo;I shall see you in a day or
      two. Good-bye, old man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger had observed Nancy, but withheld his eyes from her, and
      quickly vanished down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was that?&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you four o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;ten minutes to at least. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but if you had been
      punctual you wouldn&rsquo;t have had a fright.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had dropped into a chair, white and shaking. Tarrant&rsquo;s voice,
      abruptly reproachful, affected her scarcely less than the preceding shock.
      In the struggle to recover herself she sobbed and choked, and at length
      burst into tears. Tarrant spoke impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Surely you are not so childish&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, and went into the bedroom, where she remained for several
      minutes, returning at length without her jacket, but with her hat still
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it; and you shouldn&rsquo;t speak to me in that way. I have
      felt ill all the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at her, the young man said to himself, that love was one thing,
      wedded life another. He could make allowance for Nancy&rsquo;s weakness&mdash;but
      it was beyond his power to summon the old warmth and tenderness. If
      henceforth he loved her, it must be with husband&rsquo;s love&mdash;a phrase
      which signified to him something as distinct as possible from the ardour
      he had known; a moral attachment instead of a passionate desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was another reason for his intolerant mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hadn&rsquo;t spoken to any one before you got my note?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&mdash;Why are you treating me like this? Are you ashamed that your
      friend saw me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ashamed? not at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who did he think I was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He doesn&rsquo;t know anything about you, at all events. As you
      may guess, I have something not very pleasant to tell. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
      unkind; it was only the surprise at seeing you when I opened the door. I
      had calculated the exact time. But never mind. You look cold; warm
      yourself at the fire. You shall drink a glass of wine; it will put your
      nerves right again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I want nothing. Tell me at once what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tarrant quietly brought a bottle and glass from his cupboard. Nancy
      again refused, pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Until you have drunk,&rsquo; he said, with a smile of self-will, &lsquo;I shall tell
      you nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to make you like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sobs and tears returned. After a moment of impatience, Tarrant went up
      to her with the glass, laid a hand upon her shoulder, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, come, be reasonable. We have uncommonly serious things to talk
      about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did your friend think of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you were one of the prettiest girls he had ever been privileged to
      see, and that I was an enviable fellow to have such a visitor. There now,
      another sip, and let us have some colour back into your cheeks. There&rsquo;s
      bad news, Nancy; confoundedly bad news, dear girl. My grandmother was dead
      when I got there. Well, the foolish old woman has been muddling her
      affairs for a long time, speculating here and there without taking any
      one&rsquo;s advice, and so on; and the result is that she leaves nothing at
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Less than nothing, indeed. She owed a few hundreds that she had no means
      of paying. The joke of the thing is, that she has left an elaborate will,
      with legacies to half-a-dozen people, myself first of all. If she had been
      so good as to die two years ago, I should have come in for a thousand a
      year or so. No one suspected what was going on; she never allowed Vawdrey,
      the one man who could have been useful to her, to have an inkling of the
      affair. An advertising broker got her in his clutches. Vawdrey&rsquo;s lawyer
      has been going through her papers, and finds everything quite
      intelligible. The money has gone in lumps, good after bad. Swindling, of
      course, but perfectly legal swindling, nothing to be done about it. A
      minute or two before her death she gasped out some words of revelation to
      the nurse, enough to set Vawdrey on the track, when he was told.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the listener said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I had a talk with Vawdrey. He&rsquo;s a blackguard, but not a bad fellow.
      Wished he could help me, but didn&rsquo;t quite see how, unless I would go into
      business. However, he had a suggestion to make.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For Nancy, the pause was charged with apprehensions. She seemed to
      discover in her husband&rsquo;s face a purpose which he knew would excite her
      resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He and I have often talked about my friend Sutherland, in the Bahamas,
      and Vawdrey has an idea that there&rsquo;ll be a profitable opening in that
      quarter, before long. Sutherland has written to me lately that he thinks
      of bestirring himself in the projects I&rsquo;ve told you about; he has got the
      old man&rsquo;s consent to borrow money on the property. Now Vawdrey, naturally
      enough, would like Sutherland to join him in starting a company; the
      thoughts of such men run only on companies. So he offers, if I will go out
      to the Bahamas for a month or two, and look about me, and put myself in a
      position to make some kind of report&mdash;he offers to pay my expenses.
      Of course if the idea came to anything, and a company got floated, I
      should have shares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he paused. The listener had wide, miserable eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I told him at once that I would accept the proposal. I have no
      right to refuse. All I possess in the world, at this moment, is about
      sixty pounds. If I sold all my books and furniture, they might bring
      another sixty or so. What, then, is to become of me? I must set to work at
      something, and here&rsquo;s the first work that comes to hand. But,&rsquo; his voice
      softened, &lsquo;this puts us face to face with a very grave question; doesn&rsquo;t
      it? Are we to relinquish your money, and be both of us penniless? Or is
      there any possibility of saving it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How <i>can</i> we? How could the secret be kept?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Voice and countenance joined in utter dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me,&rsquo; said Tarrant slowly, &lsquo;a downright impossibility.
      It <i>might</i> be managed, with the help of your friend Mary, and
      granting that you yourself have the courage. But&rsquo;&mdash;he made a large
      gesture&mdash;&lsquo;of course I can&rsquo;t exact any such thing of you. It must seem
      practicable to you yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are we to do if my money is lost?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say <i>we</i>.&rsquo; He smiled generously, perhaps too generously. &lsquo;A
      man must support his wife. I shall arrange it somehow, of course, so that
      <i>you</i> have no anxiety. But&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lionel!&rsquo; She sprang up and approached him as he stood by the fireplace.
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t leave me, dear? How can you think of going so far away&mdash;for
      months&mdash;and leaving me as I am now? Oh, you won&rsquo;t leave me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He arched his eyebrows, and smiled gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s how you look at it&mdash;well, I must stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can do something here,&rsquo; Nancy continued, with rapid pleading. &lsquo;You
      can write for the papers. You always said you could&mdash;yes, you did say
      so. We don&rsquo;t need very much to live upon&mdash;at first. I shall be
      content&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A moment. You mean that the money must be abandoned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had meant it, but under his look her confused thoughts took a new
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. We needn&rsquo;t lose it. Only stay near me, and I will keep the secret,
      through everything. You will only need, then, just to support yourself,
      and that is so easy. I will tell Mary how it is. She can be trusted, I am
      sure she can. She would do anything for me. She knows that father was not
      thinking of a man such as you. It would be cruelly wrong if I lost
      everything. I will tell her, and she will help me. Scarcely any one comes
      to the house, as it is; and I will pretend to have bad health, and shut
      myself up. And then, when the time comes, Mary will go away with me, and&mdash;and
      the child shall be taken care of by some people we can trust to be kind to
      it. Horace is going to live in lodgings; and Mrs. Damerel, I am sure,
      won&rsquo;t come to see me again; and I can get rid of other people. The Barmbys
      shall think I am sulking about the will; I&rsquo;m sure they think already that
      I dislike them because of it. Let them think it; I will refuse, presently,
      to see them at all. It&rsquo;s only a few months. If I tell people I&rsquo;m not well,
      nobody will feel surprised if I go away for a month or two&mdash;now&mdash;soon.
      Mary would go with me, of course. I might go for December and January.
      Father didn&rsquo;t mean I was never to have change of air. Then there would be
      February and March at home. And then I might go away again till near the
      end of May. I&rsquo;m sure we can manage it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, breathless. Tarrant, who had listened with averted face,
      turned and spoke judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;re forgetting, Nancy. Do you propose that we shall
      never acknowledge the child? Remember that even if you were bold enough,
      after our second marriage, to acknowledge it in the face of scandal&mdash;that
      wouldn&rsquo;t be safe. Any one, if suspicion is aroused, can find out when we
      were actually married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t think of that. The child may not live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant moved, and the movement startled Nancy. It meant that she had
      pained him, perhaps made him think of her with repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly know what I am saying. You know I don&rsquo;t wish that. But all I can
      think of now is to keep you near me. I can&rsquo;t bear to be separated from
      you. I love you so much more than you love me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me just tell you what I had in mind, Nancy. Supposing the secret can
      be kept, we must eventually live abroad, that is to say, if our child is
      not to grow up a stranger to us, which neither you nor I could wish. Now,
      at Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, a lot of Americans always spend the
      winter. If I made acquaintances among them, it might be a very useful
      step, it would be preparing for the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To Nancy this sounded far from convincing. She argued against it in a
      perfectly natural way, and as any one else would have done who knew
      Tarrant. More than once he had declared to her that he would rather die
      than drag out his life in one of the new countries, that he could not
      breathe in an atmosphere of commercialism unrelieved by historic
      associations. Nancy urged that it would be better to make a home on the
      continent, whither they could go, at any moment, without a sense of exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it comes to this,&rsquo; he interrupted, with an air of resignation. &lsquo;I must
      refuse Vawdrey&rsquo;s offer, and, in doing so, refuse an excellent chance of
      providing for our future, <i>if</i>&mdash;what is by no means improbable&mdash;the
      secret should be discovered. I must turn to journalism, or be a clerk.
      Well and good. My wife decrees it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he began to hum an air, as if the matter were dismissed. There was a
      long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long would you be away?&rsquo; murmured Nancy, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose two months at most.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;November&mdash;December.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The second of those months you might be spending, as you said, away from
      London. Down in Devon, perhaps. I can&rsquo;t blame your thoughts about it; but
      it seems&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;a trifle inconsiderate, when you think
      what may result from my journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you promise me to be back by the end of the year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not promise, Nancy. But do my best. Letters take fourteen days, that&rsquo;s
      all. You should hear by every mail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not promise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I can&rsquo;t foresee how much I may have to do there, and how long it
      will take me. But you may be very sure that Vawdrey won&rsquo;t pay expenses for
      longer than he can help. It has occurred to me that I might get materials
      for some magazine articles. That would help to float me with the editors,
      you know, if it&rsquo;s necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I consented&mdash;if I did my best not to stand in your way&mdash;would
      you love me better when you came back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was a pleased laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve given in a nutshell the whole duty of a
      wife who wishes to be loved!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy tried to laugh with him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      He must be a strong man whom the sudden stare of Penury does not daunt
      and, in some measure, debase. Tarrant, whatever the possibilities of his
      nature, had fallen under a spell of indolent security, which declared its
      power only when he came face to face with the demand for vigorous action.
      The moment found him a sheer poltroon. &lsquo;What! Is it possible that I&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;am
      henceforth penniless? I, to whom the gods were so gracious? I, without
      warning, flung from sheltered comfort on to the bare road side, where I
      must either toil or beg?&rsquo; The thing seemed unintelligible. He had never
      imagined such ruin of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, he turned anxious thoughts upon the money to which his
      wife was&mdash;would be&mdash;might be&mdash;entitled. He computed the
      chances of success in the deception he and she were practising, and knew
      with shame that he must henceforth be party to a vulgar fraud. Could Nancy
      be trusted to carry through this elaborate imposition&mdash;difficult for
      the strongest-minded woman? Was it not a certainty that some negligence,
      or some accident, must disclose her secret? Then had he a wife and child
      upon his hands, to support even as common men support wife and child, by
      incessant labour. The prospect chilled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he went to the West Indies, his absence would heighten the probability
      of Nancy&rsquo;s detection. Yet he desired to escape from her. Not to abandon
      her; of that thought he was incapable; but to escape the duty&mdash;repulsive
      to his imagination&mdash;of encouraging her through the various stages of
      their fraud. From the other side of the Atlantic he would write
      affectionate, consolatory letters; face to face with her, could he support
      the show of tenderness, go through an endless series of emotional
      interviews, always reminding himself that the end in view was hard cash?
      Not for love&rsquo;s sake; he loved her less than before she proved herself his
      wife in earnest. Veritable love&mdash;no man knew better&mdash;would have
      impelled him to save himself and her from a degrading position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he committing himself to a criminality which the law would visit?
      Hardly that&mdash;until he entered into possession of money fraudulently
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In miserable night-watchings, he fell to the most sordid calculations.
      Supposing their plot revealed, would Nancy in fact be left without
      resources? Surely not,&mdash;with her brother, her aunt, her lifelong
      friends the Barmbys, to take thought for her. She could not suffer
      extremities. And upon this he blushed relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better to make up his mind that the secret must inevitably out. For the
      moment, Nancy believed she had resigned herself to his departure, and that
      she had strength to go through with the long ordeal. But a woman in her
      situation cannot be depended upon to pursue a consistent course. It is
      Nature&rsquo;s ordinance that motherhood shall be attained through phases of
      mental disturbance, which leave the sufferer scarce a pretence of
      responsibility. Nancy would play strange pranks, by which, assuredly, he
      would be driven to exasperation if they passed under his eyes. He had no
      mind to be called father; perhaps even his humanity might fail under the
      test to which, as a lover, he had given scarce a casual thought. By
      removing himself, and awaiting the issue afar off, he gained time and
      opportunity for reflection. Of course his wife could not come to want;
      that, after all, was the one clearly comforting thought. Her old servant
      would take good care of her, happen what might.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must taste of liberty again before sinking into the humdrum of married
      life. The thought of an ocean voyage, of the new life amid tropic
      splendours, excited his imagination all the more because it blended with
      the thought of recovered freedom. Marriage had come upon him with unfair
      abruptness; for such a change as that, even the ordinary bachelor demands
      a season preparative; much more, then, the young man who revelled in a
      philosophic sense of detachment, who wrote his motto &lsquo;Vixi hodie!&rsquo; For
      marriage he was simply unfit; forced together, he and his wife would soon
      be mutually detestable. A temporary parting might mature in the hearts of
      both that affection of which the seed was undeniably planted. With passion
      they had done; the enduring tenderness of a reasonable love must now unite
      them, were they to be united at all. And to give such love a chance of
      growing in him, Tarrant felt that he must lose sight of Nancy until her
      child was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it had begun already, the trial he dreaded. A letter from Nancy,
      written and posted only an hour or two after her return home&mdash;a long,
      distracted letter. Would he forgive her for seeming to be an obstacle in
      the way of what he had proposed? Would he promise her to be faithful?
      Would he&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly patience to read it through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening, on returning home about ten o&rsquo;clock, he was startled by
      the sight of Nancy&rsquo;s figure at the foot of his staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing&mdash;don&rsquo;t be frightened. But I wanted to see you tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gripped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long have you waited? What! Hours? But this is downright madness&mdash;such
      a night as this! Couldn&rsquo;t you put a note for me in the letter-box?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak so! I wanted to see you.&rsquo; She hurried her words,
      as if afraid he would refuse to listen. &lsquo;I have told Mary&mdash;I wanted
      you to know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in. But there&rsquo;s no fire, and you&rsquo;re chilled through. Do you want to
      be ill? What outrageous silliness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her vitality was indeed at a low ebb, and reproaches made her weep.
      Tarrant half carried her up to his room, made a light, and fell to his
      knees at fire-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me do it,&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed. &lsquo;Let me wait upon you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t sit still and keep quiet, you&rsquo;ll make me angry in earnest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re not <i>really</i> angry with me? I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid you couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Tarrant muttered cheerlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted to tell you that Mary will be our friend. She was speechless
      with astonishment; at first I didn&rsquo;t know what she would say; she looked
      at me as she had never looked before&mdash;as if she were the mistress,
      and I the servant. But see what I have come to; all I felt was a dread
      lest she should think it her duty to cast me off. I haven&rsquo;t a bit of pride
      left. I could have fallen on my knees before her; I almost did. But she
      was very good and kind and gentle at last. She&rsquo;ll do everything she can
      for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire in a blaze, Tarrant stood up and regarded it gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, did she think it possible?&rsquo; he asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, she did. She said it would be very difficult, but the secret might
      be kept&mdash;if I were strong enough. And I <i>am</i> strong enough&mdash;I
      <i>will</i> be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it,&rsquo; said Tarrant, taking the edge off his words
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t come again in this way. Where have you been tonight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, with friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which friends? where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People you don&rsquo;t know, Nancy, and wouldn&rsquo;t care about if you did. Do you
      know what time it is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do tell me where you have been. It isn&rsquo;t prying into your affairs. Your
      friends ought to be mine; at least, I mean, I ought to know their names,
      and something about them. Suppose I were to tell you I had been spending
      the evening with friends&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl, I shouldn&rsquo;t ask a question, unless you invited it. However,
      it&rsquo;s better to tell you that I have been making arrangements to sublet
      these chambers. I can&rsquo;t afford to keep them, even if there were any use in
      it. Harvey Munden has introduced me to a man who is likely to relieve me
      of the burden. I shall warehouse my books and furniture&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are going? Really going to leave England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected astonishment; in truth, nothing now could surprise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wasn&rsquo;t it all decided between us? Didn&rsquo;t you repeat it in your
      letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;I know&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t think it would come so soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk about it to-night,&rsquo; said Tarrant firmly. &lsquo;For one thing,
      there&rsquo;s no time. Come closer to the fire, and get warm through; then I
      must see you home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy hung her head. When, in a few moments, she looked up again, it was
      to say drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to see me home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? You don&rsquo;t care much about me. I might as well be run over&mdash;or
      anything&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this remark no sort of answer was vouchsafed. Nancy sat with her feet
      on the fender, and Tarrant kept up a great blaze with chips, which
      sputtered out their moisture before they began to crackle. He and she both
      seemed intent on this process of combustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re quite warm,&rsquo; said the young man, as if speaking to a child,
      &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s time to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy rose obediently, gazed at him with dreaming eyes, and suffered
      herself to be led away by the arm. In Chancery Lane, Tarrant hailed a
      crawling hansom. When they were driving rapidly southward, Nancy began to
      question him about the date of his departure; she learnt that he might be
      gone in less than a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you could behave quietly and sensibly, we would have an evening to
      make final arrangements.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can,&rsquo; she answered, with a calm that surprised him. &lsquo;If you go without
      letting me see you again, I don&rsquo;t know what I might do. But I can be as
      sensible as you are, if I&rsquo;m treated fairly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember, dear girl, that I have a good deal to worry me just now. Do you
      suppose I leave you with a light heart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can persuade me that you care&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I care a good deal more than I can easily say. Your position is a very
      hard one,&mdash;harder than mine. But I&rsquo;m going away to work for your
      future. I see clearly that it&rsquo;s the best thing I could do. Whether
      Vawdrey&rsquo;s ideas come to anything or not, I shall make profit out of the
      journey; I mean to write,&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s all I can do to any purpose,&mdash;and
      the material I shall get together over there will give me a start. Don&rsquo;t
      think I am cold-hearted because I talk in this way; if I broke down, so
      much the worse for both of us. The time has come for serious work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we shan&rsquo;t lose my money. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind we shan&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for you to guard against every danger. We must be
      prepared for the worst, and that responsibility rests on me. Try and keep
      your mind at ease; whatever happens, to protect you is my duty, and I
      shall not fail in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking thus, Tarrant felt the glow of virtue. His words were perfectly
      sincere, but had reference to a future which his thoughts left comfortably
      vague.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to meet again, probably for the definite parting, three days
      hence. Tarrant, whose desire for escape had now become incontrollable,
      used the intervening time in a rush of preparations. He did not debate
      with himself as to the length of his sojourn in the West Indies; that must
      be determined by circumstances. Explicitly he had avoided a promise on the
      subject. What money he possessed he would take with him; it might be to
      his interest, for Nancy&rsquo;s likewise, to exceed the term of absence provided
      for in his stipulations with Mr. Vawdrey. But all he deliberately thought
      of was the getting away. Impatient with Nancy, because of the vagaries
      resultant from her mental and physical state, he himself exhibited a
      flagrant triumph of instinct over reason. Once in enjoyment of liberty, he
      would reflect, like a practical man, on the details of his position,
      review and recognise his obligations, pay his debt to honour; but liberty
      first of all. Not his the nature to accept bondage; it demoralised him,
      made him do and say things of which he was ashamed. Only let him taste the
      breezes of ocean, and the healthful spirit which is one with rectitude
      would again inspire him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to his surprise, he neither saw nor heard from Nancy until the hour
      appointed. She came very punctually. On opening the door to her, with an
      air of resolute cheerfulness, he saw something in her face that removed
      the necessity for playing a part. It was the look which had so charmed him
      in their love-days, the indescribable look, characteristic of Nancy, and
      of her alone; a gleam between smile and laughter, a glance mingling pride
      with submission, a silent note of personality which thrilled the senses
      and touched the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; he asked, holding her hand and gazing at her. &lsquo;Some good
      news?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None that I know of. How hot your room is! Why, you look glad to see me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was I ever anything else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very pleasant surprise,&rsquo; he continued, watching her as she threw
      off her out-door things. &lsquo;I expected a doleful visage, eyes red with
      weeping.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you? See how much a man thinks of himself! If you choose to go away,
      I choose to think as little of you as possible. That&rsquo;s common sense&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to cry about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, you do. It flatters you, and you like flattery. But I&rsquo;ve been too
      obliging. I feel myself again, and there&rsquo;s no more flattery for you&mdash;till
      you come back. I don&rsquo;t ask you when that will be. I ask you nothing at
      all. I am independent of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant grew uneasy. He feared that this mood of jest would change only
      too suddenly, and her collapse into feminine feebleness be the more
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be as independent as you like,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;only keep your love for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed! It&rsquo;s your experience, is it, that the two things can go
      together? That&rsquo;s the difference between man and woman, I suppose. I shall
      love you just as little as possible&mdash;and how little that will be,
      perhaps I had better not tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he stood gazing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look very beautiful to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. I saw it for myself before I left home. But we won&rsquo;t talk about
      that. When do you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My goods will be warehoused to-morrow, and the next day I go to
      Liverpool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s so soon. We shan&rsquo;t need to see each other again. Smoke your
      pipe. I&rsquo;m going to make a cup of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiss me first. You forgot when you came in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You get no kiss by ordering it. Beg for it prettily, and we&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it all mean, Nancy? How can you have altered like this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You prefer me as I was last time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I, indeed. You make me feel that it will be very hard to leave you. I
      shall carry away a picture of you quite different from the dreary face
      that I had got to be afraid of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed, and of a sudden held out her hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I thought of that? These were the very words I hoped to hear from
      you. Now beg for a kiss, and you shall have one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, perhaps, had they spent together so harmonious an evening. Nancy&rsquo;s
      tenderness took at length a graver turn, but she remained herself, face
      and speech untroubled by morbid influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t see you again,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;because I mightn&rsquo;t be able to behave
      as I can to-day. To-day I am myself; for a long time I have been living I
      don&rsquo;t know how.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant murmured something about her state of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know all about that. A strange thought came to me last night. When
      my father was alive I fretted because I couldn&rsquo;t be independent; I wanted
      to be quite free, to live as I chose; I looked forward to it as the one
      thing desirable. Now, I look back on that as a time of liberty. I am in
      bondage, now&mdash;threefold bondage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How threefold?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To you, because I love you, and couldn&rsquo;t cease loving you, however I
      tried. Then, to my father&rsquo;s will, which makes me live in hiding, as if I
      were a criminal. And then&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What other tyranny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t expect all my love. Before long some one else will rule over
      me.&mdash;What an exchange I have made! And I was going to be so
      independent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the listener, her speech seemed to come from a maturer mind than she
      had hitherto revealed. But he suffered from the thought that this might be
      merely a pathological phase. In reminding him of her motherhood, she
      checked the flow of his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll remember,&rsquo; Nancy went on, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;m not enjoying myself whilst you
      are away. I don&rsquo;t want you to be unhappy&mdash;only to think of me, and
      keep in mind what I&rsquo;m going through. If you do that, you won&rsquo;t be away
      from me longer than you can help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said with unforced pathos, and Tarrant&rsquo;s better part made generous
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you find it too hard, dear, write to me, and tell me, and there shall
      be an end of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never. You think me wretchedly weak, but you shall see&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of your own free will you undertake it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of my own free will,&rsquo; she answered firmly. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t come to you
      penniless. It isn&rsquo;t right I should do so. My father didn&rsquo;t mean that. If I
      had had the sense and the courage to tell him, all this misery would have
      been spared. That money is mine by every right, and I won&rsquo;t lose it. Not
      only for your sake and my own&mdash;there is some one else to think of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant gave her a kind look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t count upon it. Trust to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like to hear you say that, but I don&rsquo;t wish you to be put to proof. You
      are not the kind of man to make money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like to take it. Silly boy, don&rsquo;t I love you just because you are
      <i>not</i> one of the money-making men? If you hadn&rsquo;t a penny in the
      world, I should love you just the same; and I couldn&rsquo;t love you more if
      you had millions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The change which Tarrant expected did not come. To the end, she was brave
      and bright, her own best self. She said good-bye without a tear, refused
      to let him accompany her, and so, even as she had resolved, left in her
      husband&rsquo;s mind an image beckoning his return.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before his admission to a partnership in Mr. Lord&rsquo;s business, Samuel
      Barmby lived with his father and two sisters in Coldharbour Lane. Their
      house was small, old and crumbling for lack of repair; the landlord, his
      ground-lease having but a year or two to run, looked on with equanimity
      whilst the building decayed. Under any circumstances, the family must soon
      have sought a home elsewhere, and Samuel&rsquo;s good fortune enabled them to
      take a house in Dagmar Road, not far from Grove Lane; a new and most
      respectable house, with bay windows rising from the half-sunk basement to
      the second storey. Samuel, notwithstanding his breadth of mind, privately
      admitted the charm of such an address as &lsquo;Dagmar Road,&rsquo; which looks well
      at the head of note-paper, and falls with sonority from the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barmby sisters, Lucy and Amelia by name, were unpretentious young
      women, without personal attractions, and soberly educated. They professed
      a form of Dissent; their reading was in certain religious and
      semi-religious periodicals, rarely in books; domestic occupations took up
      most of their time, and they seldom had any engagements. At appointed
      seasons, a festivity in connection with &lsquo;the Chapel&rsquo; called them forth; it
      kept them in a flutter for many days, and gave them a headache. In the
      strictest sense their life was provincial; nominally denizens of London,
      they dwelt as remote from everything metropolitan as though Camberwell
      were a village of the Midlands. If they suffered from discontent, no one
      heard of it; a confession by one or the other that she &lsquo;felt dull&rsquo; excited
      the sister&rsquo;s surprise, and invariably led to the suggestion of &lsquo;a little
      medicine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their brother they regarded with admiration, tempered by anxiety. &lsquo;Great
      talents,&rsquo; they knew by report, were often perilous to the possessor, and
      there was reason to fear that Samuel Bennett Barmby had not resisted all
      the temptations to which his intellect exposed him. At the age of
      one-and-twenty he made a startling announcement; &lsquo;the Chapel&rsquo; no longer
      satisfied the needs of his soul, and he found himself summoned to join the
      Church of England as by law established. Religious intolerance not being a
      family characteristic, Mr. Barmby and his daughters, though they looked
      grave over the young man&rsquo;s apostasy, admitted his freedom in this matter;
      their respected friend Mr. Lord belonged to the Church, and it could not
      be thought that so earnest-minded a man walked in the way to perdition. At
      the same time, Samuel began to exhibit a liking for social pleasures,
      which were, it might be hoped, innocent, but, as they kept him from home
      of evenings, gave some ground for uneasiness. He had joined a society of
      young men who met for intellectual debate, and his success as an orator
      fostered the spiritual pride already discernible in him. His next step
      could not be regarded without concern, for he became a member of the
      National Sunday League. Deceptive name! At first the Miss. Barmbys
      supposed this was a union for safe-guarding the Sabbath-day; it appalled
      them to discover that the League had quite an opposite tendency, that its
      adherents sallied forth together on &lsquo;Sunday excursions,&rsquo; that they
      received tickets for Sunday admission to picture galleries, and in various
      other ways offended orthodox feeling. But again the father and sisters
      gave patient ear to Samuel&rsquo;s elaborate arguments. They became convinced
      that he had no evil intentions. The elder girl, having caught up a
      pregnant phrase in some periodical she approved, began to remark that
      Samuel had &lsquo;a modern mind;&rsquo; and this eventually consoled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it began to be observed that Samuel talked somewhat frequently of
      Miss. Lord, the implied suggestion caused a tremor of confused feeling. To
      the Miss. Barmbys, Nancy seemed an enigmatic person; they had tried to
      like her, but could not; they objected to her assumption of superiority,
      and were in grave doubt as to her opinions on cardinal points of faith and
      behaviour. Yet, when it appeared a possibility that their brother might
      woo Miss. Lord and win her for a wife, the girls did their best to see her
      in a more favourable light. Not for a moment did it occur to them that
      Nancy could regard a proposal from Samuel as anything but an honour; to <i>them</i>
      she might behave slightingly, for they were of her own sex, and not
      clever; but a girl who prided herself on intellectual attainments must of
      course look up to Samuel Bennett with reverence. In their unworldliness&mdash;of
      a truth they were good, simple creatures&mdash;the slight difference of
      social position seemed unimportant. And with Samuel&rsquo;s elevation to a
      partnership, even that one shadowy obstacle was removed. Henceforth they
      would meet Nancy in a conciliatory spirit, and, if she insisted upon it,
      bow down before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barmby, senior, whose years drew nigh to three-score, had a great
      advantage in point of physical health over his old friend Stephen Lord,
      and his mind enjoyed a placidity which promised him length of days. Since
      the age of seventeen he had plied a pen in the office of a Life Assurance
      Company, where his salary, by small and slow increments, had grown at
      length to two hundred and fifty a year. Himself a small and slow person,
      he had every reason to be satisfied with this progress, and hoped for no
      further advance. He was of eminently sober mind, profoundly conscientious,
      and quite devoid of social ambition,&mdash;points of character which
      explained the long intimacy between him and Stephen Lord. Yet one habit he
      possessed which foreshadowed the intellectual composition of his son,&mdash;he
      loved to write letters to the newspapers. At very long intervals one of
      these communications achieved the honour of type, and then Mr Barmby was
      radiant with modest self-approval. He never signed such letters with his
      own name, but chose a pseudonym befitting the subject. Thus, if moved to
      civic indignation by pieces of orange-peel on the pavement, he styled
      himself &lsquo;Urban Rambler;&rsquo; if anxious to protest against the overcrowding of
      &lsquo;bus or railway-carriage, his signature was &lsquo;Otium cum Dignitate.&rsquo; When he
      took a holiday at the seaside, unwonted leisure and novel circumstances
      prompted him to address local editors at considerable length. The
      preservation of decency by bathers was then his favourite topic, and he
      would sign &lsquo;Pudor,&rsquo; or perchance &lsquo;Paterfamilias.&rsquo; His public epistles, if
      collected, would have made an entertaining and instructive volume, so
      admirably did they represent one phase of the popular mind. &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo;&mdash;this
      sentence frequently occurred,&mdash;&lsquo;it was not thus that our fathers
      achieved national and civic greatness.&rsquo; And again: &lsquo;All the feelings of an
      English parent revolt,&rsquo; &amp;c. Or: &lsquo;And now, sir, where is this to end?&rsquo;&mdash;a
      phrase applied at one moment to the prospects of religion and morality, at
      another to the multiplication of muffin-bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Sunday afternoon, Mr. Barmby often read aloud to his daughters, and
      in general his chosen book was &lsquo;Paradise Lost.&rsquo; These performances had an
      indescribable solemnity, but it unfortunately happened that, as his
      fervour increased, the reader became regardless of aspirates. Thus, at the
      culmination of Satanic impiety, he would give forth with shaking voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ail, orrors, ail! and thou profoundest Ell, Receive thy new
      possessor!&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, though it did not distress the girls, was painful to Samuel Bennett,
      who had given no little care to the correction of similar lapses in his
      own speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel conceived himself much ahead of his family. Quite uneducated, in
      any legitimate sense of the word, he had yet learnt that such a thing as
      education existed, and, by dint of busy perusal of penny popularities, had
      even become familiar with names and phrases, with modes of thought and of
      ambition, appertaining to a world for ever closed against him. He spoke of
      Culture, and imagined himself far on the way to attain it. His mind was
      packed with the oddest jumble of incongruities; Herbert Spencer jostled
      with Charles Bradlaugh, Matthew Arnold with Samuel Smiles; in one breath
      he lauded George Eliot, in the next was enthusiastic over a novel by Mrs.
      Henry Wood; from puerile facetiae he passed to speculations on the origin
      of being, and with equally light heart. Save for Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress and
      Robinson Crusoe, he had read no English classic; since boyhood, indeed, he
      had probably read no book at all, for much diet of newspapers rendered him
      all but incapable of sustained attention. Whatever he seemed to know of
      serious authors came to him at second or third hand. Avowing his faith in
      Christianity when with orthodox people, in the society of sceptics he
      permitted himself to smile at the old faiths,&mdash;though he preferred to
      escape this temptation, the Nonconformist conscience still reigning within
      him. At home he posed as a broad-minded Anglican, and having somewhere
      read that Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;In Memoriam&rsquo; represented this attitude, he spoke of
      the poem as &lsquo;one of the books that have made me what I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His circle of acquaintances lay apart from that in which the Lords moved;
      it consisted for the most part of young men humbly endowed in the matter
      of income, and making little pretence of social dignity. When others
      resorted to theatre or public-house, or places not so readily designated,
      Samuel and his friends met together to discourse on subjects of which they
      knew somewhat less than nothing. Some of them occasionally held audacious
      language, especially when topics such as the relations of the sexes
      invited their wisdom; they had read something somewhere which urged them
      to cast off the trammels of conventional thought; they &lsquo;ventured to say&rsquo; 
      that in a very few years &lsquo;surprising changes of opinion would come about.&rsquo; 
      These revolutionaries, after startling the more sober of their hearers,
      went quietly home to mother or landlady, supped on cheese and cocoa, and
      next day plied the cleric pen with exemplary zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel believed himself in love. That he should conceive matrimonial
      intentions with regard to Stephen Lord&rsquo;s daughter was but the natural
      issue of circumstance; from that conception resulted an amorous mood, so
      much inflamed by Nancy&rsquo;s presence that a young man, whose thoughts did not
      often transgress decorum, had every reason to suppose himself her victim.
      When Nancy rejected his formal offer of devotion, the desire to wed her
      besieged him more vigorously; Samuel was piqued at the tone of lofty
      trifling in which the girl answered his proposal; for assuredly he
      esteemed himself no less remarkable a person than he appeared in the eyes
      of his sisters, and his vanity had been encouraged by Mr. Lord&rsquo;s favour.
      Of his qualities as a man of business there was no doubt; in one direction
      or another, he would have struck the road to fortune; why Nancy should
      regard him with condescension, and make him feel at once that his suit was
      hopeless, puzzled him for many a day. He tried flattery, affecting to
      regard her as his superior in things of the intellect, but only with the
      mortifying result that Miss. Lord accepted his humility as quite natural.
      Then he held apart in dignified reserve, and found no difficulty in
      maintaining this attitude until after Mr. Lord&rsquo;s death. Of course he did
      not let his relatives know of the repulse he had suffered, but, when
      speaking to them of what had happened on Jubilee night, he made it appear
      that his estimate of Miss. Lord was undergoing modification. &lsquo;She has lost
      him, all through her flightiness,&rsquo; said the sisters to each other. They
      were not sorry, and felt free again to criticise Nancy&rsquo;s ideas of maidenly
      modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions of Mr. Lord&rsquo;s will could not but trouble the intercourse
      between Grove Lane and Dagmar Road. Mr. Barmby, senior, undertook with
      characteristic seriousness the guardianship conferred upon him. He had
      long interviews with Horace and Nancy, in which he acquitted himself
      greatly to his own satisfaction. Samuel, equally a trustee, showed his
      delicacy by holding aloof save when civility dictated a call upon the
      young people. But his hopes had revived; he was quite willing to wait
      three years for Nancy, and it seemed to him more than probable that this
      period of reflection would bring the young lady to a sense of his merits.
      In the meantime, he would pursue with energy the business now at his sole
      direction, and make it far more lucrative than when managed on Mr. Lord&rsquo;s
      old-fashioned principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks went on, it seemed more clear than at first that Nancy
      resented the authority held by Samuel and his father. They were not
      welcome at the house in Grove Lane; the Miss. Barmbys called several times
      without being admitted, though they felt sure that Nancy was at home.
      Under these circumstances, it became desirable to discover some
      intermediary who would keep them acquainted with the details of Nancy&rsquo;s
      life and of her brother&rsquo;s. Such intermediary was at hand, in the person of
      Miss. Jessica Morgan.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Until of late there had existed a bare acquaintance between Jessica and
      the Barmby family. The two or three hours which she perforce spent in
      Samuel&rsquo;s company on Jubilee night caused Jessica no little embarrassment;
      as a natural result, their meetings after that had a colour of intimacy,
      and it was not long before Miss. Morgan and the Miss. Barmbys began to see
      more of each other. Nancy, on a motive correspondent with that which
      actuated her guardians, desired Jessica&rsquo;s familiarity with the household
      in Dagmar Road; her friend could thus learn and communicate sundry facts
      of importance, else hidden from her in the retirement to which she was now
      condemned. How did the Barmbys regard her behaviour to them? Did they, in
      their questioning, betray any suspicion fraught with danger? Jessica,
      enjoying the possession of a most important secret, which she had
      religiously guarded even from her mother, made time to accept the Barmbys&rsquo; 
      invitations pretty frequently, and invited the girls to her own home as
      often as she could afford a little outlay on cakes and preserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made a salutary distraction in her life. As December drew near, she
      exhibited alarming symptoms of over-work, and but for the romance which
      assured to her an occasional hour of idleness, she must have collapsed
      before the date of her examination. As it was, she frightened one of her
      pupils, at the end of a long lesson, by falling to the floor and lying
      there for ten minutes in unconsciousness. The warning passed unheeded; day
      and night she toiled at her insuperable tasks, at times half frenzied by
      the strangest lapses of memory, and feeling, the more she laboured, only
      the more convinced that at the last moment every fact she had acquired
      would ruthlessly desert her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her place of abode favoured neither health nor mental tranquillity. It was
      one of a row of new houses in a new quarter. A year or two ago the site
      had been an enclosed meadow, portion of the land attached to what was once
      a country mansion; London, devourer of rural limits, of a sudden made
      hideous encroachment upon the old estate, now held by a speculative
      builder; of many streets to be constructed, three or four had already come
      into being, and others were mapped out, in mud and inchoate masonry,
      athwart the ravaged field. Great elms, the pride of generations passed
      away, fell before the speculative axe, or were left standing in mournful
      isolation to please a speculative architect; bits of wayside hedge still
      shivered in fog and wind, amid hoardings variegated with placards and
      scaffolding black against the sky. The very earth had lost its wholesome
      odour; trampled into mire, fouled with builders&rsquo; refuse and the noisome
      drift from adjacent streets, it sent forth, under the sooty rain, a smell
      of corruption, of all the town&rsquo;s uncleanliness. On this rising locality
      had been bestowed the title of &lsquo;Park.&rsquo; Mrs. Morgan was decided in her
      choice of a dwelling here by the euphonious address, Merton Avenue,
      Something-or-other Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old mansion&mdash;not very old, and far from beautiful, but stoutly
      built&mdash;stood grim and desolate, long dismantled, and waiting only to
      be torn down for the behoof of speculative dealers in old material. What
      aforetime was a tree-bordered drive, now curved between dead stumps, a
      mere slushy cartway; the stone pillars, which had marked the entrance,
      damaged in the rending away of metal with a market value, drooped
      sideways, ready at a touch to bury themselves in slime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through summer months the Morgans had suffered sufficiently from the
      defects of their house; with the coming on of winter, they found
      themselves exposed to miseries barely endurable. At the first slight
      frost, cistern and water-pipes went to ruin; already so damp that unlovely
      vegetation had cropped up on cellar walls, the edifice was now drenched
      with torrents of water. Plaster fell from the ceilings; paper peeled away
      down the staircase; stuccoed portions of the front began to crack and
      moulder. Not a door that would close as a door should; not a window that
      would open in the way expected of it; not a fireplace but discharged its
      smoke into the room, rather than by the approved channel. Everywhere
      piercing draughts, which often entered by orifices unexplained and
      unexplainable. From cellar floor to chimney-pot, no square inch of honest
      or trustworthy workmanship. So thin were the parti-walls that conversation
      not only might, but must, be distinctly heard from room to room, and from
      house to house; the Morgans learnt to subdue their voices, lest all they
      said should become common property of the neighbourhood. For the privilege
      of occupying such a residence, &lsquo;the interior,&rsquo; said advertisement,
      &lsquo;handsomely decorated,&rsquo; they were racked with an expenditure which, away
      in the sweet-scented country, would have housed them amid garden graces
      and orchard fruitfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, Mr. Morgan had joined an acquaintance in the establishment
      of a debt-collecting agency; his partner provided the modest capital
      needful for such an enterprise, and upon himself fell the disagreeable
      work. A man of mild temper and humane instincts, he spent his day in
      hunting people who would not or could not pay the money they owed,
      straining his wits to circumvent the fraudulent, and swooping relentlessly
      upon the victims of misfortune. The occupation revolted him, but at
      present he saw no other way of supporting the genteel appearances which&mdash;he
      knew not why&mdash;were indispensable to his life. He subsisted like a
      bird of prey; he was ever on the look out for carrion which the law
      permitted him to seize. From the point of view forced upon him, society
      became a mere system of legalised rapine. &lsquo;You are in debt; behold the
      bond. Behold, too, my authority for squeezing out of you the uttermost
      farthing. You must beg or starve? I deplore it, but I, for my part, have a
      genteel family to maintain on what I rend from your grip.&rsquo; He set his
      forehead against shame; he stooped to the basest chicanery; he exposed
      himself to insult, to curses, to threats of violence. Sometimes a whole
      day of inconceivably sordid toil resulted in the pouching of a few pence;
      sometimes his reward was a substantial sum. He knew himself despised by
      many of the creditors who employed him. &lsquo;Bad debts? For how much will you
      sell them to me?&rsquo; And as often as not he took away with his bargain a
      glance which was equivalent to a kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genteel family knew nothing of these expedients. Mrs. Morgan talked
      dolorously to her friends of &lsquo;commercial depression,&rsquo; and gave it to be
      vaguely understood that her husband had suffered great losses because he
      conducted his affairs in the spirit of a gentleman. Her son was in an
      office;&rsquo; her elder daughter was attempting the art of fiction, which did
      not promise to be lucrative; Jessica, more highly educated, would shortly
      matriculate at the University of London&mdash;a consoling prospect, but
      involving the payment of a fee that could with difficulty be afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every friend of the family held it a matter of course that Jessica would
      succeed in the examination. It seemed probable that she would have a place
      in Honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, meanwhile, the poor girl herself was repenting of the indiscreet
      boastfulness with which she had made known her purpose. To come out in an
      inferior class would be painful enough; how support the possibility of
      absolute failure? Yet she knew only too well that in certain &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; 
      she was worse than shaky. Her Greek&mdash;her Chemistry&mdash;her Algebra&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of propitiating the stern fates, she began to talk with Lucy and
      Amelia Barmby in a tone of diffidence. Half a year ago, she would have
      held her head very high in such company; now the simple goodness of the
      old-fashioned girls made an appeal to her aching heart, and their homely
      talk soothed her exhausted brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s fearfully difficult,&rsquo; she said to them one evening, as she sat in
      their parlour. &lsquo;And I lose so much time with my pupils. Really, you know,
      I haven&rsquo;t a fair chance. I was showing Nancy Lord the Algebra paper set
      last summer, and she confessed she could hardly do a single question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She couldn&rsquo;t?&rsquo; exclaimed one of the sisters in astonishment. &lsquo;But we
      always thought she was so very clever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So she is&mdash;in many things. But she never dreamt of going in for such
      an examination as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you really know more than she does?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica smiled with affected modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I have studied so much more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sweet to gain this triumph over her friend, whose progress in the
      school of life she watched with the jealousy of a girl condemned to
      sterile passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their talk was interrupted by the entrance of Samuel Barmby, and his elder
      sister, addressing him without reflection, said wonderingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam, did you know that Nancy Lord couldn&rsquo;t pass the examination that
      Miss. Morgan is going in for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica blushed, and hastened to extenuate this crude statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say that. Only that she would have to study very hard if she
      went in for the matriculation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course she would,&rsquo; Samuel assented, largely, as he took his stand
      before the fireplace and beamed upon the female trio. &lsquo;Miss Lord goes in
      for broad culture; that&rsquo;s quite a different thing from studying for
      examinations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the hearers, Jessica not excepted, this seemed to argue the spirit of
      broad culture in Samuel himself. Miss. Morgan pursued nervously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Examinations are nothing. I believe very stupid people often do well in
      them, and clever people often fail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sank on the last word, and she tried to read Barmby&rsquo;s face
      without meeting his look. Of late, a change had come about in her
      estimation of Samuel. Formerly she spoke of him with contemptuous
      amusement, in the tone set by Nancy; since she had become a friend of the
      family, his sisters&rsquo; profound respect had influenced her way of thinking,
      and in secret she was disposed rather to admire &lsquo;the Prophet.&rsquo; He had
      always struck her as a comely man, and, her education notwithstanding, she
      never perceived in his remarks that downright imbecility which excited
      Nancy&rsquo;s derision. On Jubilee night he was anything but a tedious
      companion; apart from her critical friend, Jessica had listened without
      impatience to his jests, his instructive facts, his flowing rhetoric.
      Now-a-days, in her enfeebled state of body and mind, she began to look
      forward with distinct pleasure to her occasional meetings with Samuel,
      pleasure which perhaps was enhanced by the air of condescension wherewith
      he tempered his courtesy. Morbid miseries brought out the frailty of her
      character. Desiring to be highly esteemed by Mr. Barmby, she found herself
      no less willing to join his sisters in a chorus of humbly feminine
      admiration, when he discoursed to them from an altitude. At moments, after
      gazing upon his eloquent countenance, she was beset by strange impulses
      which brought blood to her cheek, and made her dread the Miss. Barmbys&rsquo; 
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I look upon examinations,&rsquo; Samuel was saying, &lsquo;as a professional matter.
      I never went in for them myself, simply because I&mdash;I turned my
      energies in another direction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>could</i> have passed them,&rsquo; remarked one of his sisters, &lsquo;easily
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Miss. Morgan&rsquo;s presence,&rsquo;&mdash;he stroked his chin, and smiled with
      delicious fatuity&mdash;&lsquo;I prefer to say nothing on that point.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh but of course you could, Mr. Barmby,&rsquo; sounded Jessica&rsquo;s voice, in an
      unsteady falsetto, whilst her eyes were turned upon the floor. &lsquo;You would
      have thought nothing of this matriculation, which seems to me so
      dreadful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Profoundly flattered, Samuel addressed the girl in his suavest tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a theory, Miss. Morgan, that young ladies ought not to undergo
      these ordeals. The delicacy of their nervous system unfits them for such a
      strain. I&rsquo;m sure we shall all feel very glad when you are successfully
      through the trial. After it, you ought to have a long rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you ought&mdash;indeed you ought,&rsquo; assented the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said Samuel, &lsquo;my father has heard from Miss. Lord that she
      is going away for a month or two. She says her health requires it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica sat silent, still with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s a new thing, isn&rsquo;t it,&rsquo; remarked Amelia, &lsquo;for Miss. Lord to be
      in bad health?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has suffered a good deal, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Jessica, &lsquo;since her
      father&rsquo;s death. The doctor tells her she oughtn&rsquo;t to live in that dull
      house through the winter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; Samuel exclaimed, &lsquo;of course she must go at once&mdash;of
      course!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He never spoke of Nancy but with stress of unctuous generosity. This, if
      his hearers knew what he had suffered at her hands, must tell greatly to
      his credit; if they were not aware of the circumstances, such a tone would
      become him as the young lady&rsquo;s hopeful admirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear her nerves are affected,&rsquo; pursued Jessica. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t bear
      society. So unlike her, isn&rsquo;t it? She goes out very little indeed,&mdash;sometimes
      not for days together. And really she sees nobody. I&rsquo;m getting quite
      anxious about her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was an awkward one in this house, and it soon gave place to
      freer conversation. On her way home, though mechanically repeating dates
      and formulae, Jessica could not resist the tendency of her thoughts, to
      dwell on Samuel&rsquo;s features and Samuel&rsquo;s eloquence. This was a new danger;
      she had now little more than a fortnight for her final &lsquo;cram,&rsquo; and any
      serious distraction meant ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a day or two she took leave of Nancy, who had chosen for her winter
      retreat no less remote a spot than Falmouth. Horace having settled himself
      in lodgings, the house was to be shut up; Mary Woodruff of course went
      down into Cornwall. Nancy had written a letter to Mr. Barmby, senior,
      excusing herself for not being able to see him before her departure; it
      was an amiable letter, but contained frank avowal of pain and discontent
      at the prospect of her long pupilage. &lsquo;Of course I submit to the burden my
      father chose to lay upon me, and before long, I hope, I shall be able to
      take things in a better spirit. All I ask of you, dear Mr. Barmby, is to
      have forbearance with me until I get back my health and feel more
      cheerful. You know that I could not be in better hands whilst Mary is with
      me. I shall write frequently, and give you an account of myself. Let me
      hear sometimes, and show me that you make allowance for my very trying
      position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica heard the letter discussed by its recipient and his family. Samuel
      spoke with his wonted magnanimity; his father took a liberal view of the
      matter. And in writing to her friend a few days later, Jessica was able to
      say: &lsquo;I think you may safely stay at Falmouth for the whole winter. You
      will not be interfered with if you write nicely. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
      they would let you keep out of their reach <i>as long as it is necessary</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The week of Jessica&rsquo;s ordeal was now at hand. She had had another
      fainting-fit; her sleep was broken every night with hideous dreams; she
      ate scarce enough to keep herself alive; a perpetual fever parched her
      throat and burned at her temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of &lsquo;cram,&rsquo; she sat from morning to night in her
      comfortless little bedroom, bending over the smoky fire, reading
      desperately through a pile of note-books. The motive of vanity no longer
      supported her; gladly she would have crept away into a life of
      insignificance; but the fee for the examination was paid, and she must
      face the terrors, the shame, that waited her at Burlington House. No hope
      of &lsquo;passing.&rsquo; Perhaps at the last moment a stroke of mortal illness would
      come to her relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so. She found herself in the ghastly torture-hall, at a desk on which
      lay sheets of paper, not whiter than her face. Somebody gave her a scroll,
      stereotyped in imitation of manuscript&mdash;the questions to be answered.
      For a quarter of an hour she could not understand a word. She saw the face
      of Samuel Barmby, and heard his tones&mdash;&lsquo;The delicacy of a young
      lady&rsquo;s nervous system unfits her for such a strain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she went home with a half-formed intention of poisoning
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the morrow saw her seated again before another scroll of stereotype,
      still thinking of Samuel Barmby, still hearing his voice. The man was
      grown hateful to her; he seemed to haunt her brain malignantly, and to
      paralyse her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day in the room of torture, until all was done. Then upon her
      long despair followed a wild, unreasoning hope. Though it rained, she
      walked all the way home, singing, chattering to herself, and reached the
      house-door without consciousness of the distance she had traversed. Her
      mother and sister came out into the hall; they had been watching for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did a good paper to-day&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ve passed after all&mdash;yes,
      I feel sure I&rsquo;ve passed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look dreadful,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Morgan. &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re wet through&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did a good paper to-day&mdash;I feel sure I&rsquo;ve passed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down to a meal, but could not swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel sure I&rsquo;ve passed&mdash;I feel sure&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she fell from the chair, to all appearances stone-dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took her upstairs, undressed her, sent for the doctor. When he came,
      she had been lying for half-an-hour conscious, but mute. She looked
      gravely at him, and said, as if repeating a lesson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The delicacy of a young lady&rsquo;s nervous system unfits her for such a
      strain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly,&rsquo; repeated the doctor, with equal gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; she added eagerly, &lsquo;let Mr. Barmby know at once that I have
      passed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall know at once,&rsquo; said the doctor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      A lady who lived at Kilburn, and entertained largely in a house not
      designed for large entertainment, was &lsquo;at home&rsquo; this evening. At eleven
      o&rsquo;clock the two drawing-rooms contained as many people as could sit and
      stand with semblance of comfort; around the hostess, on the landing,
      pressed a crowd, which grew constantly thicker by affluence from the
      staircase. In the hall below a &lsquo;Hungarian band&rsquo; discoursed very loud
      music. Among recent arrivals appeared a troupe of nigger minstrels,
      engaged to give their exhilarating entertainment&mdash;if space could be
      found for them. Bursts of laughter from the dining-room announced the
      success of an American joker, who, in return for a substantial cheque,
      provided amusement in fashionable gatherings. A brilliant scene. The air,
      which encouraged perspiration, was rich with many odours; voices
      endeavouring to make themselves audible in colloquy, swelled to a
      tumultuous volume that vied with the Hungarian clangours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the staircase, squeezed behind two very fat women in very
      low dresses, stood Horace Lord. His heated countenance wore a look of
      fretful impatience; he kept rising upon his toes in an endeavour to
      distinguish faces down in the hall. At length his expression changed, and
      with eager eyes he began to force a way for himself between the fat women.
      Not unrewarded with glaring glances, and even with severe remarks, he
      succeeded in gaining the foot of the staircase, and came within reach of
      the persons for whom he had been waiting. These were Mrs. Damerel and
      Fanny French. The elder lady exhibited a toilet of opulence corresponding
      with her mature charms; the younger, as became a <i>debutante</i>, wore
      graceful white, symbol of her maiden modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You promised to be early,&rsquo; said Horace, addressing Mrs. Damerel, but
      regarding Fanny, who stood in conversation with a florid man of uncertain
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get here before, my dear boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely you haven&rsquo;t brought that fellow with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! You mustn&rsquo;t talk in that way. We met at the door. Mrs. Dane knows
      him. What does it matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace moved aside to Fanny. Flushed with excitement, her hair adorned
      with flowers, she looked very pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; he said, gripping her hand more violently than he intended.
      &lsquo;Let us get upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you hurt me! Don&rsquo;t be so silly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man beside her gave Horace a friendly nod. His name was Mankelow.
      Horace had met him once or twice of late at Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s, but did not
      like him, and felt still less disposed to do so now that Mankelow was
      acquainted with Fanny French. He suspected that the two were more familiar
      than Fanny pretended. With little ceremony, he interposed himself between
      the girl and this possible rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you make her come earlier?&rsquo; he said to Fanny, as they began a
      slow upward struggle in the rear of Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t fashionable to come early.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! Look at the people here already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny threw up her chin, and glanced back to see that Mankelow was
      following. In his vexation, Horace was seized with a cough&mdash;a cough
      several times repeated before he could check it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your cold&rsquo;s no better,&rsquo; said Fanny. &lsquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to have come out at
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> better,&rsquo; he replied sharply. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve
      coughed to-day. Do you mean you would rather not have found me here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How silly you are! People will hear what you&rsquo;re saying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Fanny&rsquo;s &lsquo;first season,&rsquo; but not her first &lsquo;at home.&rsquo; Mrs. Damerel
      seemed to be taking an affectionate interest in her, and had introduced
      her to several people. Horace, gratified in the beginning, now suffered
      from jealousy; it tortured him to observe Fanny when she talked with men.
      That her breeding was defective, mattered nothing in this composite world
      of pseudo-elegance. Young Lord, who did not lack native intelligence,
      understood by this time that Mrs. Damerel and her friends were far from
      belonging to a high order of society; he saw vulgarity rampant in every
      drawing-room to which he was admitted, and occasionally heard things which
      startled his suburban prejudices. But Fanny, in her wild enjoyment of
      these novel splendours, appeared to lose all self-control. She flirted
      outrageously, and before his very eyes. If he reproached her, she laughed
      at him; if he threatened to free himself, she returned a look which
      impudently bade him try. Horace had all her faults by heart, and no longer
      tried to think that he respected her, or that, if he married such a girl,
      his life could possibly be a happy one; but she still played upon his
      passions, and at her beck he followed like a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostess, Mrs. Dane, a woman who looked as if she had once been
      superior to the kind of life she now led, welcomed him with peculiar
      warmth, and in a quick confidential voice bade him keep near her for a few
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some one I want to introduce you to&mdash;some one I&rsquo;m sure you
      will like to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Obeying her, he soon lost sight of Fanny; but Mrs. Dane continued to talk,
      at intervals, in such a flattering tone, that his turbid emotions were
      soothed. He had heard of the Chittles? No? They were very old friends of
      hers, said Mrs. Dane, and she particularly wanted him to know them. Ah,
      here they came; mother and daughter. Horace observed them. Mrs. Chittle
      was a frail, worn, nervous woman, who must once have been comely; her
      daughter, a girl of two-and-twenty, had a pale, thin face of much
      sweetness and gentleness. They seemed by no means at home in this company;
      but Mrs. Chittle, when she conversed, assumed a vivacious air; the
      daughter, trying to follow her example, strove vainly against an excessive
      bashfulness, and seldom raised her eyes. Why he should be expected to pay
      special attention to these people, Horace was at a loss to understand; but
      Mrs. Chittle attached herself to him, and soon led him into familiar
      dialogue. He learnt from her that they had lived for two or three years in
      a very quiet country place; they had come up for the season, but did not
      know many people. She spoke of her daughter, who stood just out of
      earshot,&mdash;her eyes cast down, on her face a sad fixed smile,&mdash;and
      said that it had been necessary almost to force her into society. &lsquo;She
      loves the country, and is so fond of books; but at her age it&rsquo;s really a
      shame to live like a nun&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr. Lord?&rsquo; Decidedly it
      was, said Horace. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m doing my best,&rsquo; pursued Mrs. Chittle, &lsquo;to cure her
      of her shyness. She is really afraid of people&mdash;and it&rsquo;s such a pity.
      She says that the things people talk about don&rsquo;t interest her; but <i>all</i>
      people are not frivolous&mdash;are they, Mr. Lord?&rsquo; Horace hoped not; and
      presently out of mere good-nature he tried to converse with the young lady
      in a way that should neither alarm her shyness nor prove distasteful to
      her intelligence. But with very little success. From time to time the girl
      glanced at him with strange timidity, yet seemed quite willing to listen
      as long as he chose to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, being at a considerable distance from home, was to return to the
      boarding-house where her chaperon now lived, and have a room there for the
      night. Horace disliked this arrangement, for the objectionable Mankelow
      lived in the same house. When he was able to get speech with Fanny, he
      tried to persuade her to go with him all the way home to Camberwell in a
      cab. Miss. French would not listen to the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who ever heard of such a thing? It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proper! Oh, I like that!&rsquo; he replied, with scathing irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can either like it or not. Mrs. Damerel wouldn&rsquo;t dream of allowing
      it. I think she&rsquo;s quite as good a judge of propriety as you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in a corner of the dining-room. Fanny, having supped much to her
      satisfaction, had a high colour, and treated her lover with more than
      usual insolence. Horace had eaten little, but had not refrained from
      beverages; he was disposed to assert himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me that we ought to have an understanding. You never do as I
      wish in a single thing. What do you mean by it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;re going to be nasty&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the gesture of a servant-girl who quarrels with her young man at
      the street-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the kind of treatment you&rsquo;ve given me lately,&rsquo; said Horace,
      with muffled anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I shall do just as I like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. That&rsquo;s as much as to say that you care nothing about me. I&rsquo;m
      not going to be the slave of a girl who has no sense of honour&mdash;not
      even of decency. If you wish me to speak to you again you must speak
      first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he left her, Fanny laughing scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      It drew towards one o&rsquo;clock when, having exhausted the delights of the
      evening, and being in a decidedly limp condition, Mrs. Damerel and her
      protegee drove home. Fanny said nothing of what had passed between her and
      Horace. The elder lady, after keeping silence for half the drive, spoke at
      length in a tone of indulgent playfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you talked a good deal with Mr. Mankelow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for long. Now and then. He took me down to supper&mdash;the first
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid somebody will be a little jealous. I shall get into trouble. I
      didn&rsquo;t foresee this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody must treat me in a reasonable way,&rsquo; Fanny answered, with a dry
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure he will,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel suavely. &lsquo;But I feel myself a
      little responsible, you know. Let me put you on your guard against Mr.
      Mankelow. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s rather a dangerous man. I have heard rather
      alarming stories about him. You see he&rsquo;s very rich, and very rich men, if
      they&rsquo;re rather handsome as well, say and do things&mdash;you understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he really very rich?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, several thousands a year, and a prospect of more when relatives
      die. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that he is a bad man. He belongs to a very good
      family, and I believe him perfectly honourable. He would never do any one
      any harm&mdash;or, if he happened to, without meaning it, I&rsquo;m quite sure
      he&rsquo;d repair it in the honourable way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said he was dangerous&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To a young lady who is already engaged. Confess that you think him rather
      good-looking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having inflamed the girl&rsquo;s imagination, Mrs. Damerel presently dropped the
      subject, and fell again into weary silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon of the next day she received a call from Horace, who found her
      over tea and toast in her private sitting-room. The young man looked
      bilious; he coughed, too, and said that he must have caught fresh cold
      last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That house was like an oven. I won&rsquo;t go to any more such places. That
      isn&rsquo;t my idea of enjoying myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel examined him with affectionate solicitude, and reflected
      before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been living rather fast lately?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He avoided her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite sure? How much money have you spent this last month?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By careful interrogation&mdash;the caressing notes of her voice seemed to
      convey genuine feeling&mdash;Mrs. Damerel elicited the fact that he had
      spent not less than fifty pounds in a few weeks. She looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would our little Fanny say to this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what she would say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he unburdened himself of his complaints against the frivolous charmer,
      Mrs. Damerel listening with a compassionate smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all too true, dear boy. But didn&rsquo;t I warn you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have made her worse. And I more than half believe you have purposely
      put her in the way of that fellow Mankelow. Now I tell you plainly&rsquo;&mdash;his
      voice quivered&mdash;&lsquo;if I lose her, I&rsquo;ll raise all the money I can and
      play the very devil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! no naughty words! Let us talk about something else till you are
      quieter.&mdash;What did you think of Mrs. Chittle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought nothing of her, good or bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of her daughter, then. Isn&rsquo;t she a sweet, quiet girl? Do you know that
      she is rich? It&rsquo;s perfectly true. Mrs. Chittle is the widow of a man who
      made a big fortune out of a kind of imitation velvet. It sold only for a
      few years, then something else drove it out of the market; but the money
      was made. I know all about it from Mrs. Dane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me,&rsquo; said Horace peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Damerel continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor girl has been very unfortunate. In the last year of her father&rsquo;s
      life they lived in good style, town-house and country-house. And she fell
      in love with somebody who&mdash;who treated her badly; broke it off, in
      fact, just before the wedding. She had a bad illness, and since then she
      has lived as her mother told you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know she told me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;oh, I took it for granted. She said you had had a long talk. You
      can see, of course, that they&rsquo;re not ordinary people. Didn&rsquo;t Winifred&mdash;her
      name is Winifred&mdash;strike you as very refined and lady-like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She hardly spoke half-a-dozen words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s her nervousness. She has quite got out of the habit of society.
      But she&rsquo;s very clever, and so good. I want you to see more of her. If she
      comes here to tea, will you&mdash;just to please me&mdash;look in for
      half-an-hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head aside, wistfully. Horace vouchsafed no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear boy, I know very well what a disappointment you are suffering. Why
      not be quite open with me? Though I&rsquo;m only a tiresome old aunt, I feel
      every bit as anxious for your happiness as if I were your mother&mdash;I
      do indeed, Horace. You believe me, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been very kind, in many ways. But you&rsquo;ve done harm to Fanny&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No harm whatever, Horace&mdash;believe me. I have only given her an
      opportunity of showing what she really is. You see now that she thinks of
      nothing at all but money and selfish pleasures. Compare her, my dear, with
      such a girl as Winifred Chittle. I only mean&mdash;just to show you the
      difference between a lady and such a girl as Fanny. She has treated you
      abominably, my poor boy. And what would she bring you? Not that I wish you
      to marry for money. I have seen too much of the world to be so foolish, so
      wicked. But when there <i>are</i> sweet, clever, lady-like girls, with
      large incomes&mdash;! And a handsome boy like you! You may blush, but
      there&rsquo;s no harm in telling the truth. You are far too modest. You don&rsquo;t
      know how you look in the eyes of an affectionate, thoughtful girl&mdash;like
      Winifred, for instance. It&rsquo;s dreadful to think of you throwing yourself
      away! My dear, it may sound shocking to you, but Fanny French isn&rsquo;t the
      sort of girl that men <i>marry</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace showed himself startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are so young,&rsquo; pursued the mature lady, with an indulgent smile. &lsquo;You
      need the advice of some one who knows the world. In years to come, you
      will feel very grateful to me. Now don&rsquo;t let us talk any more of that,
      just now; but tell me something about Nancy. How much longer does she mean
      to stay in Cornwall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She talks of another month or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what have her guardians to say to that? Why, she has been away for
      nearly half a year. How can that be called living at the old house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no business of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor of mine, you mean to say. Still, it does seem rather strange. I
      suppose she is quite to be trusted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trusted? What harm can come to her? She&rsquo;s keeping out of Sam Barmby&rsquo;s
      way, that&rsquo;s all. I believe he plagued her to marry him. A nice husband for
      Nancy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we had taken to each other,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel musingly. &lsquo;I think
      she was a little jealous of the attention I had paid to <i>you</i>. But
      perhaps we shall do better some day. And I&rsquo;m quite content so long as <i>you</i>
      care a little for me, dear boy. You&rsquo;ll never give me up, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was asked with unusual show of feeling; she leaned forward, her eyes
      fixed tenderly upon the boy&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would never let a Fanny French come between us, Horace dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only wish you hadn&rsquo;t brought her among your friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some day you will be glad of what I did. Whatever happens, I am your best
      friend&mdash;the best and truest friend you will ever have. You will know
      it some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice impressed Horace, its emotion was so true. Several times through
      the day he recalled and thought of it. As yet he had felt nothing like
      affection for Mrs. Damerel, but before their next meeting an impulse he
      did not try to account for caused him to write her a letter&mdash;simply
      to assure her that he was not ungrateful for her kindness. The reply that
      came in a few hours surprised and touched him, for it repeated in yet
      warmer words all she had spoken. &lsquo;Let me be in the place of a mother to
      you, dear Horace. Think of me as if I were your mother. If I were your
      mother indeed, I could not love you more.&rsquo; He mused over this, and
      received from it a sense of comfort which was quite new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the winter he had been living as a gentleman of assured
      independence. This was managed very simply. Acting on Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s
      counsel he insured his life, and straightaway used the policy as security
      for a loan of five hundred pounds from a friend of Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s. The
      insurance itself was not effected without a disagreeable little episode.
      As a result of the medical examination, Horace learnt, greatly to his
      surprise, that he would have to pay a premium somewhat higher than the
      ordinary. Unpleasant questions were asked: Was he quite sure that he knew
      of no case of consumption in his family? Quite sure, he answered stoutly,
      and sincerely. Why? Did the doctor think <i>him</i> consumptive? Oh dear
      no, but&mdash;a slight constitutional weakness. In fine, the higher
      premium must be exacted. He paid it with the indifference of his years,
      but said nothing to Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon began the sowing of wild oats. At two-and-twenty, after
      domestic restraint and occupations that he detested, he was let loose upon
      life. Five hundred pounds seemed to him practically inexhaustible. He did
      not wish to indulge in great extravagance; merely to see and to taste the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, the rapture of those first nights, when he revelled amid the tumult of
      London, pursuing joy with a pocket full of sovereigns! Theatres,
      music-halls, restaurants and public-houses&mdash;he had seen so little of
      these things, that they excited him as they do a lad fresh from the
      country. He drew the line nowhere. Love of a worthy woman tells for
      chastity even in the young and the sensual; love of a Fanny French merely
      debauches the mind and inflames the passions. Secure in his paganism,
      Horace followed where the lures of London beckoned him; he knew not
      reproach of conscience; shame offered but thin resistance to his boiling
      blood. By a miracle he had as yet escaped worse damage to health than a
      severe cold, caught one night after heroic drinking. That laid him by the
      heels for a time, and the cough still clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than two years he would command seven thousand pounds, and a share
      in the business now conducted by Samuel Barmby. What need to stint himself
      whilst he felt able to enjoy life? If Fanny deceived him, were there not,
      after all, other and better Fannys to be won by his money? For it was a
      result of this girl&rsquo;s worthlessness that Horace, in most things so
      ingenuous, had come to regard women with unconscious cynicism. He did not
      think he could be loved for his own sake, but he believed that, at any
      time, the show of love, perhaps its ultimate sincerity, might be won by
      display of cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway in the month of May he again caught a severe cold, and was confined
      to the house for nearly three weeks. Mrs. Damerel, who nursed him well and
      tenderly, proposed that he should go down for change of air to Falmouth.
      He wrote to Nancy, asking whether she would care to see him. A prompt
      reply informed him that his sister was on the point of returning to
      London, so that he had better choose some nearer seaside resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Hastings for a few days, but wearied of the place, and came
      back to his London excitements. Nancy, however, had not yet returned; nor
      did she until the beginning of July.

      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      This winter saw the establishment of the South London Fashionable Dress
      Supply Association&mdash;the name finally selected by Beatrice French and
      her advisers. It was an undertaking shrewdly conceived, skilfully planned,
      and energetically set going. Beatrice knew the public to which her
      advertisements appealed; she understood exactly the baits that would prove
      irresistible to its folly and greed. In respect that it was a public of
      average mortals, it would believe that business might be conducted to the
      sole advantage of the customer. In respect that it consisted of women, it
      would give eager attention to a scheme that permitted each customer to
      spend her money, and yet to have it. In respect that it consisted of
      ignorant and pretentious women, this public could be counted upon to
      deceive itself in the service of its own vanity, and maintain against all
      opposition that the garments obtained on this soothing system were
      supremely good and fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a basis of assumptions such as these, there was every possibility of
      profitable commerce without any approach to technical fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of the familiar &lsquo;goose-club,&rsquo; licensed victuallers make
      themselves the bankers of people who are too weak-minded to save their own
      money until they wish to spend it, and who are quite content to receive in
      ultimate return goods worth something less than half the deposit. By means
      of the familiar teapot, grocers persuade their customers that an excellent
      trade can be done by giving away the whole profit on each transaction.
      Beatrice French, an observant young woman, with a head for figures, had
      often noted and reflected upon these two egregious illustrations of human
      absurdity. Her dressmaking enterprise assimilated the features of both,
      and added novel devices that sprang from her own fruitful brain. The
      &lsquo;Fashion Club,&rsquo; a wheel within a wheel, was merely the goose-club;
      strictly a goose-club, for the licensed victualler addresses himself to
      the male of the species. The larger net, cast for those who lacked money
      or a spirit of speculation, caught all who, in the realm of grocery, are
      lured by the teapot. Every sovereign spent with the Association carried a
      bonus, paid not in cash but in kind. These startling advantages were made
      known through the medium of hand-bills, leaflets, nicely printed little
      pamphlets, gorgeously designed placards; the publicity department, being
      in the hands of Mr. Luckworth Crewe, of Farringdon Street, was most ably
      and vigorously conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks also to Luckworth Crewe, Beatrice had allied herself with partners,
      who brought to the affair capital, experience, and activity. Before
      Christmas&mdash;an important point&mdash;the scene of operations was
      ready: a handsome shop, with the new and attractive appendages (so-called
      &lsquo;club-room,&rsquo; refreshment-bar, &amp;c.) which Crewe and Beatrice had
      visioned in their prophetic minds. Before the close of the year
      substantial business had been done, and 1888 opened with exhilarating
      prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ineptitude of uneducated English women in all that relates to their
      attire is a fact that it boots not to enlarge upon. Beatrice French could
      not be regarded as an exception; for though she recognised monstrosities,
      she very reasonably distrusted her own taste in the choice of a garment.
      For her sisters, monstrosities had a distinct charm, and to this class of
      women belonged all customers of the Association who pretended to think for
      themselves as to wherewithal they should be clothed. But women in general
      came to the shop with confessed blankness of mind; beyond the desire to
      buy something that was modish, and to pay for it in a minus quantity, they
      knew, felt, thought nothing whatever. Green or violet, cerulean or
      magenta, all was one to them. In the matter of shape they sought merely a
      confident assurance from articulate man or woman&mdash;themselves being
      somewhat less articulate than jay or jackdaw&mdash;that this or that was
      &lsquo;the feature of the season.&rsquo; They could not distinguish between a becoming
      garment and one that called for the consuming fires of Heaven. It is often
      assumed as a commonplace that women, whatever else they cannot do, may be
      trusted to make up their minds about habiliments. Nothing more false, as
      Beatrice French was abundantly aware. A very large proportion of the
      servant-keeping females in Brixton, Camberwell, and Peckham could not,
      with any confidence, buy a chemise or a pair of stockings; and when it
      came to garments visible, they were lost indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny French began to regret that she had not realised her capital, and
      put it into the Association. Wishing at length to do so, she met with a
      scornful rebuff. Beatrice would have none of her money, but told her she
      might use the shop like any other customer, which of course Fanny did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peachey, meanwhile, kept declaring to both her sisters that they must
      not expect to live henceforth in De Crespigny Park on the old nominal
      terms. Beatrice was on the way to wealth; Fanny moved in West End society,
      under the chaperonage of a rich woman; they ought to be ashamed of
      themselves for not volunteering handsome recognition of the benefits they
      had received beneath their sister&rsquo;s roof. But neither Beatrice nor Fanny
      appeared to see the matter in this light. The truth was, that they both
      had in view a change of domicile. The elder desired more comfort and more
      independence than De Crespigny Park could afford her; the younger desired
      a great many things, and flattered herself that a very simple step would
      put her in possession of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house no longer took any interest in the fortunes of his
      sisters-in-law. He would not bid them depart, he would not bid them stay,
      least of all would he demand money from them. Of money he had no need, and
      he was the hapless possessor of a characteristic not to be found in any
      other member of his household&mdash;natural delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Peachey lived only for his child, the little boy, whose newly
      prattling tongue made the sole welcome he expected or cared for on his
      return from a hard day&rsquo;s work. Happily the child had good health, but he
      never left home without dread of perils that might befall it in his
      absence. On the mother he counted not at all; a good-tempered cow might
      with more confidence have been set to watch over the little one&rsquo;s safety.
      The nurse-girl Emma, retained in spite of her mistress&rsquo;s malice, still
      seemed to discharge her duties faithfully; but, being mortal, she demanded
      intervals of leisure from time to time, and at such seasons, as Peachey
      too well knew, the child was uncared for. Had his heart been resolute as
      it was tender, he would long ago have carried out a project which haunted
      him at every moment of anger or fear. In the town of Canterbury lived a
      sister of his who for several years had been happily wedded, but remained
      childless. If the worst came to the worst, if his wife compelled him to
      the breaking-up of a home which was no home, this married sister would
      gladly take the little boy into her motherly care. He had never dared to
      propose the step; but Ada might perchance give ready assent to it, even
      now. For motherhood she had no single qualification but the physical.
      Before her child&rsquo;s coming into the world, she snarled at the restraints it
      imposed upon her; at its birth, she clamoured against nature for the pains
      she had to undergo, and hated her husband because he was the intermediate
      cause of them. The helpless infant gave her no pleasure, touched no
      emotion in her heart, save when she saw it in the nurse&rsquo;s care, and
      received female compliments upon its beauty. She rejected it at night
      because it broke her sleep; in the day, because she could not handle it
      without making it cry. When Peachey remonstrated with her, she stared in
      insolent surprise, and wished that <i>he</i> had had to suffer all her
      hardships of the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peachey could not be said to have any leisure. On returning from business
      he was involved forthwith in domestic troubles and broils, which consumed
      the dreary evening, and invaded even his sleep. Thus it happened that at
      long intervals he was tempted, instead of going home to dinner, to spend a
      couple of hours at a certain small eating-house, a resort of his bachelor
      days, where he could read the newspapers, have a well-cooked chop in
      quietude, and afterwards, if acquaintances were here, play a game of
      chess. Of course he had to shield this modest dissipation with a flat
      falsehood, alleging to his wife that business had kept him late. Thus on
      an evening of June, when the soft air and the mellow sunlight overcame him
      with a longing for rest, he despatched a telegram to De Crespigny Park,
      and strolled quietly about the streets until the hour and his appetite
      pointed him tablewards. The pity of it was that he could not dismiss
      anxieties; he loathed the coward falsehood, and thought more of home than
      of his present freedom. But at least Ada&rsquo;s tongue was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in the familiar corner, and turned over illustrated
      papers, whilst his chop hissed on the grid. Ah, if he were but unmarried,
      what a life he might make for himself now that the day&rsquo;s labour brought
      its ample reward! He would have rooms in London, and a still, clean
      lodging somewhere among the lanes and fields. His ideals expressed the
      homeliness of the man. On intellect he could not pride himself; his
      education had been but of the &lsquo;commercial&rsquo; order; he liked to meditate
      rather than to read; questions of the day concerned him not at all. A weak
      man, but of clean and kindly instincts. In mercantile life he had
      succeeded by virtue of his intensely methodical habits&mdash;the
      characteristic which made him suffer so from his wife&rsquo;s indolence,
      incapacity, and vicious ill-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his marriage he had thought of women as domestic beings. A wife was
      the genius of home. He knew men who thanked their wives for all the
      prosperity and content that they enjoyed. Others he knew who told quite a
      different tale, but these surely were sorrowful exceptions. Nowadays he
      saw the matter in a light of fuller experience. In his rank of life
      married happiness was a rare thing, and the fault could generally be
      traced to wives who had no sense of responsibility, no understanding of
      household duties, no love of simple pleasures, no religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there was the point&mdash;no religion. Ada had grown up to regard
      church-going as a sign of respectability, but without a shadow of
      religious faith. Her incredible ignorance of the Bible story, of Christian
      dogmas, often amazed him. Himself a believer, though careless in the
      practice of forms, he was not disturbed by the modern tendency to look for
      morals apart from faith; he had not the trouble of reflecting that an
      ignorant woman is the last creature to be moralised by anything but the
      Christian code; he saw straight into the fact&mdash;that there was no hope
      of impressing Ada with ideas of goodness, truthfulness, purity, simply
      because she recognised no moral authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      For such minds no moral authority&mdash;merely as a moral authority&mdash;is
      or can be valid. Such natures are ruled only by superstition&mdash;the
      representative of reasoned faith in nobler beings. Rob them of their
      superstition, and they perish amid all uncleanliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou shalt not lie&mdash;for God consumes a liar in the flames of hell!
      Ada Peachey could lend ear to no admonition short of that. And, living
      when she did, bred as she was, only a John Knox could have impressed her
      with this menace&mdash;to be forgotten when the echoes of his voice had
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not enjoy his chop this evening. In the game of chess that followed
      he played idly, with absent thoughts. And before the glow of sunset had
      died from the calm heaven he set out to walk homeward, anxious,
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On approaching the house he suffered, as always, from quickened pulse and
      heart constricted with fear. Until he knew that all was well, he looked
      like a man who anticipates dread calamity. This evening, on opening the
      door, he fell back terror-stricken. In the hall stood a police-constable,
      surrounded by a group of women: Mrs. Peachey, her sisters, Emma the
      nurse-girl, and two other servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, here you are at last!&rsquo; exclaimed his wife, in a voice exhausted with
      rage. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re just in time to see this beast taken off to the lock-up.
      Perhaps you&rsquo;ll believe me now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? What has she done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stolen money, that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done&mdash;your precious Emma! She&rsquo;s been
      at it for a long time; I&rsquo;ve told you some one was robbing me. So I marked
      some coins in my purse, and left it in the bedroom whilst we were at
      dinner; and then, when I found half-a-crown gone&mdash;and it was her
      evening out, too&mdash;I sent for a policeman before she knew anything,
      and we made her turn out her pockets. And there&rsquo;s the half-crown! Perhaps
      you&rsquo;ll believe it this time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s face declared her guilt; she had hardly attempted denial. Then,
      with a clamour of furious verbosity, Ada enlightened her husband on other
      points of Emma&rsquo;s behaviour. It was a long story, gathered, in the last few
      minutes, partly from the culprit herself, partly from her fellow-servants.
      Emma had got into the clutches of a jewellery tallyman, one of the fellows
      who sell trinkets to servant-girls on the pay-by-instalment system. She
      had made several purchases of gewgaws, and had already paid three or four
      times their value, but was still in debt to the tallyman, who threatened
      all manner of impossible proceedings if she did not make up her arrears.
      Bottomless ignorance and imbecile vanity had been the girl&rsquo;s ruin, aided
      by a grave indiscretion on Peachey&rsquo;s part, of which he was to hear
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one must go to the police-station and make a formal charge. Ada would
      undertake this duty with pious eagerness, enjoying it all the more because
      of loud wailings and entreaties which the girl now addressed to her
      master. Peachey looked at his sisters-in-law, and in neither face
      perceived a compassionate softening. Fanny stood by as at a spectacle
      provided for her amusement, without rancour, but equally without pity.
      Beatrice was contemptuous. What right, said her countenance, had a
      servant-girl to covet jewellery? And how pitiable the spirit that prompted
      to a filching of half-crowns! For the criminals of finance, who devastate
      a thousand homes, Miss French had no small admiration; crimes such as the
      present were mean and dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada reappeared, hurriedly clad for going forth; but no one had fetched a
      cab. Incensed, she ordered her husband to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you speaking to?&rsquo; he replied wrathfully. &lsquo;I am not your servant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny laughed. The policeman, professionally calm, averted a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Peachey. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite willing to walk. Come
      along, constable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The girl doesn&rsquo;t go from my house until she&rsquo;s properly dressed.&rsquo; He
      turned to the other servants. &lsquo;Please to blow the whistle at the door, or
      get a cab somehow. Emma, go upstairs and put your things on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was about time you behaved like a man,&rsquo; fell quietly from Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rsquo; He looked sternly at the speaker. &lsquo;It <i>is</i> time, and
      that you shall all know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The culprit, suddenly silent, obeyed his order. The constable went out at
      the front door, and there waited whilst a cab-summoning whistle shrilled
      along De Crespigny Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada had ascended to the first landing, to make sure that the culprit did
      not escape her. Beatrice and Fanny retired into the drawing-room. After a
      lapse of some ten minutes two cabs rattled up to the door from opposite
      directions, each driver lashing his horse to gain the advantage. So nearly
      were they matched, that with difficulty the vehicles avoided a collision.
      The man who had secured a place immediately in front of the doorsteps,
      waved his whip and uttered a shout of insulting triumph; his rival
      answered with volleys of abuse, and drove round as if meditating an
      assault; it was necessary for the policeman to interfere. Whereupon the
      defeated competitor vowed that it was sanguinary hard lines; that for the
      sanguinary whole of this sanguinary day had he waited vainly for a
      sanguinary fare, and but for a sanguinary stumble of his sanguinary horse&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of waiting, and suspicious of the delay, Ada went up to the room
      where the servant was supposed to be making ready. It was a little room,
      which served as night-nursery; by the girl&rsquo;s bed stood a cot occupied by
      the child. Ada, exclaiming &lsquo;Now, come along!&rsquo; opened the door violently. A
      candle was burning; the boy, awake but silent, sat up in his cot, and
      looked about with sleepy, yet frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not be seen. Astonished and enraged, Ada rushed forward; she
      found the girl lying on the floor, and after bending over her, started
      back with a cry half of alarm, half of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come up here at once!&rsquo; she screamed down the staircase. &lsquo;Come up! The
      wretch has cut her throat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rush of feet. Peachey, the first to enter, saw a gash on the
      neck of the insensible girl; in her hand she held a pair of scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rsquo; he said to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police-officer, animated by a brisk succession of events such as he
      could not hope for every day, raised the prostrate figure, and speedily
      announced that the wound was not mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s fainted, that&rsquo;s all. Tried to do for herself with them scissors,
      and didn&rsquo;t know the way to go about it. We&rsquo;ll get her off sharp to the
      surgeon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be attempted suicide, now, as well as stealing,&rsquo; cried Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrified by the crowd of noisy people, the child began to cry loudly.
      Peachey lifted him out of the cot, wrapped a blanket about him, and
      carried him down to his own bedroom. There, heedless of what was going on
      above, he tried to soothe the little fellow, lavishing caresses and tender
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My little boy will be good? He&rsquo;ll wait here, quietly, till father comes
      back? Only a few minutes, and father will come back, and sit by him. Yes&mdash;he
      shall sleep here, all night&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada burst into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think you&rsquo;d better go and look after your dear Emma. As if I
      didn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s been going on! It&rsquo;s all come out, so you needn&rsquo;t tell
      me any lies. You&rsquo;ve been giving her money. The other servants knew of it;
      she confessed it herself. Oh, you&rsquo;re a nice sort of man, you are! Men of
      your sort are always good at preaching to other people. You&rsquo;ve given her
      money&mdash;what does <i>that</i> mean? I suspected it all along. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t have her sent away; oh no! She was so good to the child&mdash;and
      so good to somebody else! A dirty servant! I&rsquo;d choose some one better than
      that, if I was a man. How much has she cost you? As much, no doubt, as one
      of the swell women in Piccadilly Circus&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peachey turned upon her, the sweat beading on his ghastly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go!&mdash;Out of this room&mdash;or by God I shall do something fearful!&mdash;Out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She backed before him. He seized her by the shoulders, and flung her
      forth, then locked the door. From without she railed at him in the
      language of the gutter and the brothel. Presently her shouts were mingled
      with piercing shrieks; they came from the would-be-suicide, who, restored
      to consciousness, was being carried down for removal in the cab. Peachey,
      looking and feeling like a man whom passion had brought within sight of
      murder, stopped his ears and huddled himself against the bedside. The
      child screamed in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length came silence. Peachey opened the door, and listened. Below,
      voices sounded in quiet conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is down there?&rsquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All of us except Ada,&rsquo; replied Beatrice. &lsquo;The policeman said she needn&rsquo;t
      go unless she liked, but she <i>did</i> like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran up to the deserted bedroom, carefully gathered together his child&rsquo;s
      day-garments, and brought them down. Then, as well as he could, he dressed
      the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it time to get up?&rsquo; inquired the little three-year-old, astonished at
      all that was happening, but soothed and amused by the thought that his
      father had turned nurse. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t light yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are going somewhere with father, dear. Somewhere nice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue between them, in sweet broken words such as the child had not
      yet outgrown, and the parent did not wish to abandon for common speech,
      went on until the dressing was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, will my boy show me where his clothes are for going out? His cap,
      and his coat&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, they were up in the nursery; boy would show father&mdash;and
      laughed merrily that he knew something father didn&rsquo;t. A few minutes more,
      and the equipment was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now wait for me here&mdash;only a minute. My boy won&rsquo;t cry, if I leave
      him for a minute?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cry! of course not!&rsquo; Peachey descended to the drawing-room, closed the
      door behind him, and stood facing his sisters-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to tell you that I am going away, and taking the child with me.
      Ada needn&rsquo;t expect me back to-night&mdash;nor ever. As long as I live I
      will never again be under the same roof with her. You, Beatrice, said it
      was about time I behaved like a man. You were right. I&rsquo;ve put up long
      enough with things such as no man ought to endure for a day. Tell your
      sister that she may go on living here, if she chooses, for another six
      months, to the end of the year&mdash;not longer. She shall be supplied
      with sufficient money. After Christmas she may find a home for herself
      where she likes; money will be paid to her through a lawyer, but from this
      day I will neither speak nor write to her. You two must make your own
      arrangements; you have means enough. You know very well, both of you, why
      I am taking this step; think and say about me what you like. I have no
      time to talk, and so I bid you good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not seek to detain him, but stood mute whilst he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy, timid and impatient, was at the head of the stairs. His
      father enveloped him warmly in a shawl, and so they went forth. It was not
      long before they met with a vacant cab. Half-an-hour&rsquo;s drive brought them
      to the eating-house where Peachey had had his chop that evening, and here
      he obtained a bedroom for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven o&rsquo;clock the child slept peacefully. The father, seated at a
      table, was engaged in writing to a solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight he lay softly down by the child&rsquo;s side, and there, until dawn,
      listened to the low breathing of his innocent little bedfellow. Though he
      could not sleep, it was joy, rather than any painful excitement, that kept
      him wakeful. A great and loathsome burden had fallen from him, and in the
      same moment he had rescued his boy out of an atmosphere of hated impurity.
      At length he could respect himself, and for the first time in four long
      years he looked to the future with tranquil hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careless of the frank curiosity with which the people of the house
      regarded him, he went down at seven o&rsquo;clock, and asked for a railway
      time-table. Having found a convenient train to Canterbury, he ordered
      breakfast for himself and the child to be laid in a private room. It was a
      merry meal. Sunshine of midsummer fell warm and bright upon the table; the
      street below was so full of busy life that the little boy must needs have
      his breakfast by the window, where he could eat and look forth at the same
      time. No such delightful holiday had he ever enjoyed. Alone with father,
      and going away by train into wonderful new worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Emma coming?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was significant that he did not speak of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove to the railway station, Peachey no less excited than the child.
      From here he despatched a telegram to his partners, saying that he should
      be absent for a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the train, struggling slowly out of London&rsquo;s welter, through the
      newest outposts of gloom and grime, bore them, hearts companioned in love
      and blamelessness, to the broad sunny meadows and the sweet hop-gardens of
      Kent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serves her jolly well right,&rsquo; said Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lot <i>she&rsquo;ll</i> care,&rsquo; said Fanny. &lsquo;I should think myself precious
      lucky. She gets rid of him, and of the kid too, and has as much as she
      wants to live on. It&rsquo;s better than she deserves.&mdash;Do you believe he&rsquo;s
      been carrying on with that girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss. French laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s been a jolly good row to-night, if we never see another. We
      shall all be in the papers!&rsquo; The prospect had charms for Fanny. &lsquo;What are
      you going to do? Live here till Christmas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice was quietly reviewing the situation. She kept silence, and her
      sister also became meditative. Suddenly Fanny inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a place is Brussels?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brussels? Why? I know nothing about it. Not much of a place, I think;
      sprouts come from there, don&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a big town,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;and a lively sort of place, they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you ask me, if you know? What about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual when performing the operation which, in her, answered to thought,
      Fanny shuffled with her hands on her waist. At a distance from Beatrice
      she stood still, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one I know is going there. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to go too. I want to see
      abroad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister asked several searching questions, but Fanny would not make
      known whether the friend was male or female.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised,&rsquo; remarked the woman of business,
      indifferently, &lsquo;if you go and make a fool of yourself before long. That
      Mrs. Damerel is up to some game with you; any one could see it with half
      an eye. I suppose it isn&rsquo;t Lord that&rsquo;s going to Brussels?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny sputtered her disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had any common sense,&rsquo; pursued her sister, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d stick to him;
      but you haven&rsquo;t. Oh yes, you think you can do better. Very well, we shall
      see. If you find yourself in a hole one of these days, don&rsquo;t expect <i>me</i>
      to pull you out. I wouldn&rsquo;t give you a penny to save you from the
      workhouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re asked. I know where all <i>your</i> money &lsquo;ll go to. And
      that&rsquo;s into Crewe&rsquo;s pocket. He&rsquo;ll fool you out of all you have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice reddened with wrath. But, unlike the other members of her family,
      she could command her tongue. Fanny found it impossible to draw another
      word from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning from the police-station, haggard and faint with excitement,
      but supported by the anticipation of fresh attacks upon her husband, Ada
      immediately learnt what had happened. For the first moment she could
      hardly believe it. She rushed upstairs, and saw that the child was really
      gone; then a blind frenzy took hold upon her. Alarming and inexplicable
      sounds drew her sisters from below; they found her, armed with something
      heavy, smashing every breakable object in her bedroom&mdash;mirrors,
      toilet-ware, pictures, chimney-piece ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone mad!&rsquo; shrieked Fanny. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll kill us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That beast shall pay for it!&rsquo; yelled Ada, with a frantic blow at the
      dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanton destruction of property revolted all Beatrice&rsquo;s instincts.
      Courageous enough, she sprang upon the wild animal, and flung her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now indeed the last trace of veneer was gone, the last rag of
      pseudo-civilisation was rent off these young women; in physical conflict,
      vilifying each other like the female spawn of Whitechapel, they revealed
      themselves as born&mdash;raw material which the mill of education is
      supposed to convert into middle-class ladyhood. As a result of being held
      still by superior strength Ada fell into convulsions, foamed at the mouth,
      her eyes starting from their sockets; then she lay as one dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve killed her,&rsquo; cried the terrified Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fear. Give me some water to pitch over her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a full jug from another bedroom, she drenched the prostrate figure.
      When Ada came round she was powerless; even her rancorous lips could utter
      only a sound of moaning. The sisters stripped her stark naked on the
      floor, made a show of drying her with towels, and tumbled her into bed.
      Then Beatrice brewed a great jorum of hot whisky-punch, and after drinking
      freely to steady her shaken nerves, poured a pint or so down Mrs.
      Peachey&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There won&rsquo;t be a funeral just yet,&rsquo; she remarked, with a laugh. &lsquo;Now
      we&rsquo;ll have supper; I feel hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to bed at something after midnight. The servants, having stolen
      a bottle of spirits from the cupboard, which Beatrice left open, both got
      drunk, and slept till morning upon the kitchen-floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, Miss. French, attired as a walking advertisement of the
      South London Fashionable Dress Supply Association, betook herself to
      Farringdon Street for an interview with her commercial friend. Crewe was
      absent, but one of three clerks, who occupied his largest room, informed
      her that it could not be very long before he returned, and being so
      familiar a figure here, she was permitted to wait in the agent&rsquo;s sanctum.
      When the door closed upon her, the three young men discussed her character
      with sprightly freedom. Beatrice, the while, splendidly indifferent to the
      remarks she could easily divine, made a rapid examination of loose papers
      lying on Crewe&rsquo;s desk, read several letters, opened several books, and
      found nothing that interested her until, on turning over a slip of paper
      with pencilled figures upon it, she discovered a hotel-bill, the heading:
      Royal Hotel, Falmouth. It was for a day and night&rsquo;s entertainment, the
      debtor &lsquo;Mr. Crewe,&rsquo; the date less than a week gone by. This document she
      considered attentively, her brows knitted, her eyes wide. But a sound
      caused her to drop it upon the desk again. Another moment, and Crewe
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked keenly at her, and less good-humouredly than of wont. These
      persons never shook hands, and indeed dispensed, as a rule, with all forms
      of civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you staring at?&rsquo; asked Crewe bluffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are <i>you</i> staring at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, that I know.&rsquo; He hung up his hat, and sat down. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a note to
      write; wait a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The note written, and given to a clerk, Crewe seemed to recover
      equanimity. His visitor told him all that happened in De Crespigny Park,
      even to the crudest details, and they laughed together uproariously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a flat,&rsquo; Beatrice then informed him. &lsquo;Just find me
      something convenient and moderate, will you? A bachelor&rsquo;s flat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about Fanny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has something on; I don&rsquo;t know what it is. Talks about going to
      Brussels&mdash;with a friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe looked astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to see after her. I know what the end &lsquo;ll be. Brussels? I&rsquo;ve
      heard of English girls going there, but they don&rsquo;t usually come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can I do? I&rsquo;m pretty certain that Damerel woman has a game on hand.
      She doesn&rsquo;t want Fanny to marry her nephew&mdash;if Lord <i>is</i> her
      nephew. She wants his money, that&rsquo;s my idea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine, too,&rsquo; remarked the other quietly. &lsquo;Look here, old chap, it&rsquo;s your
      duty to look after your little damned fool of a sister; I tell you that
      plainly. I shan&rsquo;t think well of you if you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice displayed eagerness to defend herself. She had done her best;
      Fanny scorned all advice, and could not be held against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she given up all thought of Lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think so. And it looks as if he was going his own
      way, and didn&rsquo;t care much. He never writes to her now. Of course it&rsquo;s that
      woman&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have to look into Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s affairs. Might be worth while.
      Where is she living?&rsquo; He made a note of the information. &lsquo;Well, anything
      else to tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice spoke of business matters, then asked him if he had been out of
      town lately. The question sounded rather abrupt, and caused Crewe to
      regard her with an expression she privately interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A few short runs. Nowhere particular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh?&mdash;Not been down into Cornwall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you after? What business is it of yours? If you&rsquo;re going to spy
      on me, I&rsquo;ll soon let you know that I won&rsquo;t stand that kind of thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself,&rsquo; said Beatrice, with a cold smile. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      been spying, and you can go where you like for anything I care. I guessed
      you <i>had</i> been down there, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe kept silence, his look betraying uneasiness as well as anger.
      Speaking at length, he fixed her with keen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s any satisfaction to you, you&rsquo;re welcome to know that I have been
      into Cornwall&mdash;and to Falmouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice merely nodded, and still he searched her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just answer me a plain question, old chap. Come, there&rsquo;s no nonsense
      between us; we know each other&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, we know each other,&rsquo; Miss. French answered, her lips puckering a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you know about <i>her</i>? What has she been doing all this
      time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know just as little about her as I care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You care a good deal more than you&rsquo;ll confess. I wouldn&rsquo;t be up to
      women&rsquo;s tricks, if I were you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She revolted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all, I suppose I <i>am</i> a woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I suppose so.&rsquo; Crewe grinned good-naturedly. &lsquo;But that isn&rsquo;t in the
      terms of our partnership, you remember. You can be a reasonable fellow
      enough, when you like. Just tell me the truth. What do you know about
      Nancy Lord?&rsquo; Beatrice assumed an air of mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that, if you tell me what it is you want of her. Is it her
      money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her money be damned!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s herself, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what if it is? What have <i>you</i> to say to it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell, and she muttered &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just bear that in mind, then. And now that I&rsquo;ve answered your question,
      answer mine. What have you heard about her? Or what have you found out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes again and again, but in a mocking voice said,
      &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re telling me a lie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a brute to say so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged fierce glances, but could not meet each other&rsquo;s eyes
      steadily. Crewe, mastering his irritation, said with a careless laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, I believe you. Didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you, old chap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be called that!&rsquo; She was trembling with stormy emotions. &lsquo;You
      shall treat me decently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. Old girl, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a good deal younger than you are. And I&rsquo;m a good deal better than
      you, in every way. I&rsquo;m a lady, at all events, and you can&rsquo;t pretend to be
      a gentleman. You&rsquo;re a rough, common fellow&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holloa! Holloa! Draw it mild.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled, and in some degree abashed; his eyes, travelling to the
      door, indicated a fear that this singular business-colloquy might be
      overheard. But Beatrice went on, without subduing her voice, and, having
      delivered herself of much plain language, walked from the room, leaving
      the door open behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, she returned from her day&rsquo;s occupations to dinner, in De
      Crespigny Park, at seven o&rsquo;clock. To-day her arrival at home was
      considerably later. About three o&rsquo;clock she made a call at the
      boarding-house where Mrs. Damerel lived, but was disappointed in her wish
      to see that lady, who would not be in before the hour of dining. She
      called again at seven, and Mrs. Damerel received her very graciously. It
      was the first time they had met. Beatrice, in no mood for polite grimaces,
      at once disclosed the object of her visit; she wanted to talk about Fanny;
      did Mrs. Damerel know anything of a proposed journey to Brussels? The lady
      professed utter ignorance of any such intention on Fanny&rsquo;s part. She had
      not seen Fanny for at least a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be? She told me she dined here last Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very strange,&rsquo; answered Mrs. Damerel, with suave concern. &lsquo;She
      certainly did not dine here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the Sunday before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your sister has dined here only once, Miss. French, and that was three
      months ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t understand it. Haven&rsquo;t you been taking her to theatres, and
      parties, and that kind of thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have taken her once to a theatre, and twice to evening &ldquo;at homes.&rdquo; The
      last time we were together anywhere was at Mrs. Dane&rsquo;s, about the middle
      of May. Since then I have seen her hardly at all. I&rsquo;m very much afraid you
      are under some misconception. Thinking your sister was engaged to marry my
      nephew, Mr. Lord, I naturally desired to offer her a few friendly
      attentions. But it came out, at length, that she did not regard the
      engagement as serious. I was obliged to speak gravely to my young nephew,
      and beg him to consider his position. There is the second dinner-bell, but
      I am quite at your service, Miss. French, if you wish to question me
      further.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice was much inclined to resent this tone, and to use her vernacular.
      But it seemed only too probable that Fanny had been deceiving her, and, as
      she really feared for the girl&rsquo;s safety, prudence bade her be civil with
      Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you help me to find out what Fanny has really been doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s quite out of my power. She never confided in me, and it
      is so long since I have seen anything of her at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s best to speak plainly,&rsquo; said Beatrice, in her business tone. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t
      you think of any man, in the society you introduced her to, who may be
      trying to lead her astray?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Miss. French! The society in which I move is not what you seem to
      suppose. If your sister is in any danger of <i>that</i> kind, you must
      make your inquiries elsewhere&mdash;in an inferior rank of life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice no longer contained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I know rather more than you think about your kind of society.
      There&rsquo;s not much to choose between the men and the women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. French, I believe you reside in a part of London called Camberwell.
      And I believe you are engaged in some kind of millinery business. This
      excuses you for ill-manners. All the same, I must beg you to relieve me of
      your presence.&rsquo; She rang the bell. &lsquo;Good evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say we shall see each other again,&rsquo; replied Beatrice, with an
      insulting laugh. &lsquo;I heard some one say to-day that it might be as well to
      find out <i>who you really are</i>. And if any harm comes to Fanny, I
      shall take a little trouble about that inquiry myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel changed colour, but no movement betrayed anxiety. In the
      attitude of dignified disdain, she kept her eyes on a point above Miss.
      French&rsquo;s head, and stood so until the plebeian adversary had withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sat down, and for a few minutes communed with herself. In the
      end, instead of going to dinner, she rang her bell again. A servant
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Mankelow in the dining-room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask him to be kind enough to come here for a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With little delay, Mr. Mankelow answered the summons which called him from
      his soup. He wore evening dress; his thin hair was parted down the middle;
      his smooth-shaven and rather florid face expressed the annoyance of a
      hungry man at so unseasonable an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do forgive me,&rsquo; began Mrs. Damerel, in a pathetic falsetto. &lsquo;I have been
      so upset, I felt obliged to seek advice immediately, and no one seemed so
      likely to be of help to me as you&mdash;a man of the world. Would you
      believe that a sister of that silly little Miss. French has just been here&mdash;a
      downright virago&mdash;declaring that the girl has been led astray, and
      that I am responsible for it? Can you imagine such impertinence? She has
      fibbed shockingly to the people at home&mdash;told them she was constantly
      here with me in the evenings, when she must have been&mdash;who knows
      where. It will teach me to meddle again with girls of that class.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mankelow stood with his hands behind him, and legs apart, regarding the
      speaker with a comically puzzled air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mrs. Damerel,&rsquo;&mdash;he had a thick, military sort of voice,&mdash;&lsquo;why
      in the world should this interpose between us and dinner? Afterwards, we
      might&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am really anxious about the silly little creature. It would be
      extremely disagreeable if my name got mixed up in a scandal of any kind.
      You remember my telling you that she didn&rsquo;t belong exactly to the
      working-class. She has even a little property of her own; and I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if she has friends who might make a disturbance if her&mdash;her
      vagaries could be in any way connected with me and my circle. Something
      was mentioned about Brussels. She has been chattering about some one who
      wanted to take her to Brussels&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener arched his eyebrows more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What <i>can</i> it matter to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, I have no acquaintance with any one who could do such things&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course not. And even if you had, I understand that the girl is
      long out of her teens&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s her own affair&mdash;and that of the man who cares to purchase
      such amusement. By-the-bye, it happens rather oddly that I myself have to
      run over to Brussels on business; but I trust&rsquo;&mdash;he laughed&mdash;&lsquo;that
      my years and my character&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Mankelow, absurd! It&rsquo;s probably some commercial traveller, or man
      of that sort, don&rsquo;t you think? The one thing I <i>do</i> hope is, that, if
      anything like this happens, the girl will somehow make it clear to her
      friends that <i>I</i> had no knowledge whatever of what was going on. But
      that can hardly be hoped, I fear!&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes crossed; they stood for a moment perusing vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think it might be hoped,&rsquo; said Mankelow airily. &lsquo;She seemed to me
      a rather reckless sort of young person. It&rsquo;s highly probable she will
      write letters which release every one but herself from responsibility. In
      fact&rsquo;&mdash;he gazed at her with a cynical smile&mdash;&lsquo;my knowledge of
      human nature disposes me to assure you that she certainly will. She might
      even, I should say, write a letter to <i>you</i>&mdash;perhaps a cheeky
      sort of letter, which would at once set your mind at ease.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you really take that view&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do indeed. Don&rsquo;t you think we might dismiss the matter, and dine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until noon of to-day, Mrs. Peachey had kept her bed, lying amid the wreck
      wrought by last night&rsquo;s madness. She then felt well enough to rise, and
      after refreshment betook herself by cab to the offices of Messrs Ducker,
      Blunt &amp; Co., manufacturers of disinfectants, where she conversed with
      one of the partners, and learnt that her husband had telegraphed his
      intention to be absent for a day or two. Having, with the self-respect
      which distinguished her, related her story from the most calumnious point
      of view, she went home again to nurse her headache and quarrel with Fanny.
      But Fanny had in the meantime left home, and, unaccountable fact, had
      taken with her a large tin box and a dress-basket; heavily packed, said
      the servants. Her direction to the cabman was merely Westminster Bridge,
      which conveyed to Mrs. Peachey no sort of suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Beatrice came back, and learnt this event, she went apart in wrathful
      gloom. Ada could not engage her in a quarrel. It was a wretchedly dull
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked next morning, and Beatrice announced her purpose of going to
      live by herself as soon as possible. But she would not quarrel. Left
      alone, Ada prepared to visit certain of their relatives in different parts
      of London, to spread among them the news of her husband&rsquo;s infamy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mary Woodruff unlocked the house-door and entered the little hall, it
      smelt and felt as though the damp and sooty fogs of winter still lingered
      here, untouched by the July warmth. She came alone, and straightway spent
      several hours in characteristic activity&mdash;airing, cleaning,
      brightening. For a few days there would be no servant; Mary, after her
      long leisure down in Cornwall, enjoyed the prospect of doing all the work
      herself. They had reached London last evening, and had slept at a family
      hotel, where Nancy remained until the house was in order for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, their arrival timed with a change of weather, which brought
      clouds and rain. The glories of an unshadowed sky would have little more
      than availed to support Nancy&rsquo;s courage as she passed the creaking little
      gate and touched the threshold of a home to which she returned only on
      compulsion; gloom overhead, and puddles underfoot, tried her spirit
      sorely. She had a pale face, and thin cheeks, and moved with languid step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first glance was at the letter-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head. During their absence letters had been re-addressed by
      the post-office, and since the notice of return nothing had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure a letter has been lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it may have been. But there&rsquo;ll be an answer to your last very soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Most likely I shall never hear again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nancy sat by the window of the front room, looking, as she had looked
      so many a time, at the lime tree opposite and the house visible through
      wet branches. A view unchanged since she could remember; recalling all her
      old ambitions, revolts, pretences, and ignorances; recalling her father,
      who from his grave still oppressed her living heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere near sounded the wailing shout of a dustman. It was like the
      voice of a soul condemned to purge itself in filth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary!&rsquo; She rose up and went to the kitchen. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t live here! It will
      kill me if I have to live in this dreadful place. Why, even you have been
      crying; I can see you have. If <i>you</i> give way, think what it must be
      to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only for a day or two, dear,&rsquo; answered Mary. &lsquo;We shall feel at home
      again very soon. Miss. Morgan will come this evening, and perhaps your
      brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must do something. Give me some work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary could not but regard this as a healthy symptom, and she suggested
      tasks that called for moderate effort. Sick of reading&mdash;she had read
      through a whole circulating library in the past six months&mdash;Nancy
      bestirred herself about the house; but she avoided her father&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace did not come to-day; a note arrived from him, saying that he would
      call early to-morrow morning. But at tea-time Jessica presented herself.
      She looked less ghostly than half a year ago; the grave illness through
      which she had passed seemed to have been helpful to her constitution. Yet
      she was noticeably changed. In her letters Nancy had remarked an excessive
      simplicity, a sort of childishness, very unlike Jessica&rsquo;s previous way of
      writing; and the same peculiarity now appeared in her conversation. By
      turns she was mawkish and sprightly, tearful and giggling. Her dress,
      formerly neglected to the point of untidiness, betrayed a new-born taste
      for fashionable equipment; she suddenly drew attention to it in the midst
      of serious talk, asking with a bashful smirk whether Nancy thought it
      suited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I got it at Miss. French&rsquo;s place&mdash;the Association, you know. It&rsquo;s
      really wonderful how cheap things are there. And the very best cut, by
      dressmakers from Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy wondered, and felt that her diminishing regard for Miss. Morgan had
      suffered a fresh blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much news to receive and impart. In writing from Falmouth, Nancy
      had referred to the details of her own life with studied ambiguity. She
      regretted having taken Jessica into her confidence, and avoided penning a
      word which, if read by any one but her correspondent, would betray the
      perilous secret. Jessica, after her illness, was inclined to resent this
      extreme caution, which irritated her curiosity; but in vain she assured
      Nancy that there was not the least fear of her letters falling into wrong
      hands. For weeks at a time she heard nothing, and then would come a
      letter, long indeed, but without a syllable of the information she
      desired. Near the end of May she received a line or two, &lsquo;I have been
      really ill, but am now much better. I shall stay here only a few weeks
      more. Don&rsquo;t be anxious; I am well cared for, and the worst is over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the interpretation from Nancy&rsquo;s lips, and laughed and cried over
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you must have suffered, my poor dear! And to be separated from the
      little darling! Oh, it&rsquo;s too cruel! You are sure they will be kind to it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary has every confidence in the woman. And I like the look of her; I
      don&rsquo;t feel uneasy. I shall go there very often, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when is <i>he</i> coming back? He oughtn&rsquo;t to have kept away all this
      time. How unkind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; Nancy replied, with sudden reserve. &lsquo;He is acting for the
      best. You mustn&rsquo;t ask me about that; you shall know more some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica, whose face made legible presentment of her every thought, looked
      disappointed and peevish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are really going in for the examination again?&rsquo; Nancy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course I am!&rsquo; answered the other perkily; &lsquo;but not till summer of
      next year. I&rsquo;m not allowed to study much yet; the doctor says I might do
      my brain a serious injury. I read a great deal; books that rest the mind&mdash;poetry
      and fiction; of course only the very best fiction. I shall soon be able to
      begin teaching again; but I must be very careful. Only an hour or two a
      day at first, and perhaps quite young children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the girl felt a certain pride in what she had undergone. Her
      failure to matriculate was forgotten in the sense that she offered a most
      interesting case of breakdown from undue mental exertion. The doctor had
      declared his astonishment that she held up until the examination was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He simply wouldn&rsquo;t believe me when I told him the hours I worked. He said
      I ought to be on my trial for attempted suicide!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed with extravagant conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have quite made friends with the Barmbys,&rsquo; said Nancy, eyeing her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are very nice people. Of course the girls quite understand what a
      difference there is between themselves and me. I like them because they
      are so modest; they would never think of contradicting my opinion about
      anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what about the Prophet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever quite understood him,&rsquo; Jessica replied, with an
      obvious confusion which perplexed her friend. &lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t at all the kind of
      man you thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt I was wrong,&rsquo; Nancy hastened to say. &lsquo;It was prejudice. And you
      remember that I never had any fault to find with his&mdash;his character.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You disliked him,&rsquo; said the other sharply. &lsquo;And you still dislike him.
      I&rsquo;m sure you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So plainly did Jessica desire a confirmation of this statement, that Nancy
      allowed herself to be drawn into half avowing a positive dislike for
      Samuel. Whereupon Jessica looked pleased, and tossed her head in a
      singular way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I needn&rsquo;t remind you,&rsquo; fell from Nancy, after a moment of troubled
      reflection, &lsquo;how careful you must be in talking about me to the Barmbys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t have the slightest fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weren&rsquo;t you delirious in your illness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think I was indeed! For a long time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you said nothing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About you? Oh, not a word; I&rsquo;m quite sure. I talked all the time about my
      studies. The doctor heard me one day repeating a long bit of Virgil. And I
      kept calling for bits of paper to work out problems in Geometrical
      Progression. Just fancy! I don&rsquo;t think most girls are delirious in that
      way. If I had said anything about you that sounded queer, of course mother
      would have told me afterwards. Oh, it was quite an intellectual delirium.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Jessica, since her illness, become an insufferable simpleton? or&mdash;Nancy
      wondered&mdash;was it she herself who, through experience and sorrows, was
      grown wiser, and saw her friend in a new light? It troubled her gravely
      that the preservation of a secret more than ever momentous should depend
      upon a person with so little sense. The girl&rsquo;s departure was a relief; but
      in the silence that followed upon silly talk, she had leisure to
      contemplate this risk, hitherto scarce taken into account. She spoke of it
      with Mary, the one friend to whom her heart went out in absolute trust,
      from whom she concealed but few of her thoughts, and whose moral worth,
      only understood since circumstances compelled her reliance upon it, had
      set before her a new ideal of life. Mary, she well knew, abhorred the
      deceit they were practising, and thought hard things of the man who made
      it a necessity; so it did not surprise her that the devoted woman showed
      no deep concern at a new danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more the shame than anything else, that I fear now,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;If
      I have to support myself and my child, I shall do it. How, I don&rsquo;t know;
      but other women find a way, and I should. If he deserts me, I am not such
      a poor creature as to grieve on that account; I should despise him too
      much even to hate him. But the shame of it would be terrible. It&rsquo;s common,
      vulgar cheating&mdash;such as you read of in the newspapers&mdash;such as
      people are punished for. I never thought of it in that way when he was
      here. Yet he felt it. He spoke of it like that, but I wouldn&rsquo;t listen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary heard this with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he wish you to give it up?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;You never told me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said he would rather we did. But that was when he had never thought of
      being in want himself. Afterwards&mdash;yes, even then he spoke in the
      same way; but what could we do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fear that he will forsake you,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;You will hear from him
      very soon. He knows the right and the wrong, and right will be stronger
      with him in the end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If only I were sure that he has heard of his child&rsquo;s birth. If he <i>has</i>,
      and won&rsquo;t even write to me, then he is no man, and it&rsquo;s better we should
      never see each other again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the hours of postal delivery, and listened with throbbing heart
      to the double knocks at neighbouring houses. When the last postman was
      gone by, she sat down, sick with disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At bedtime she said to Mary, &lsquo;My little baby is asleep; oh, if I could but
      see it for a moment!&rsquo; And tears choked her as she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than two months since she had heard from her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Tarrant wrote as frequently as he had promised. She learnt
      speedily of his arrival at New York, then that he had reached Nassau, the
      capital of the Bahamas, then that he was with his friend Sutherland on the
      little island amid the coral reefs. Subsequent letters, written in buoyant
      spirits, contained long descriptions of the scenery about him, and of the
      life he led. He expressed a firm confidence in Sutherland&rsquo;s enterprises;
      beyond a doubt, there was no end of money to be made by an energetic man;
      he should report most favourably to Mr. Vawdrey, whose co-operation would
      of course be invaluable. For his own part, whether he profited or not from
      these commercial schemes, he had not been mistaken in foreseeing material
      for journalism, even for a book. Yes, he should certainly write a book on
      the Bahamas, if only to expose the monstrous system of misgovernment which
      accounted for the sterility into which these islands had fallen. The
      climate, in winter at all events, was superb. Sutherland and he lay about
      in delicious sunshine, under a marvellous sky, smoking excellent cigars,
      and talking over old Oxford days. He quoted Tennyson: &lsquo;Larger
      constellations burning,&rsquo; &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of December, when Nancy, according to their agreement, began to
      hope for his return, a letter in a very different tone burdened her with
      dismal doubts. Tarrant had quarrelled with his friend. He had discovered
      that Sutherland was little better than a swindler. &lsquo;I see that the
      fellow&rsquo;s professed energy was all sham. He is the laziest scamp
      imaginable; lazier even than his boozing old father. He schemes only to
      get money out of people; and his disappointment on finding that <i>I</i>
      have no money to lose, has shown itself at length in very gross forms. I
      find he is a gambler; there has just been a tremendous row between him and
      an American, whom he is said to have cheated at cards. Last year he was
      for several weeks in Mexico City, a place notorious for gambling, and
      there lost a large sum of money that didn&rsquo;t belong to him.&rsquo; The upshot was
      that he could no longer advise Mr. Vawdrey to have anything to do with
      Sutherland. But he must not leave the Bahamas yet; that would be most
      unwise, as he was daily gathering most valuable information. Vawdrey might
      be induced to lend him a hundred pounds or so. But he would write again
      very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the close of January when he dated his next letter. Vawdrey had
      sent him fifty pounds; this, however, was to include the cost of his
      return to England. &lsquo;See, then, what I have decided. I shall make a hurried
      tour through the West Indian Islands, then cross to the States, and travel
      by land to New York or Boston, seeing all I can afford to on the way. If I
      have to come home as a steerage passenger, never mind; that, too, will be
      valuable experience.&rsquo; There followed many affectionate phrases, but
      Nancy&rsquo;s heart remained cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote next from Washington, after six weeks&rsquo; silence. Difficulties of
      which he would speak at length in another letter had caused him to
      postpone answering the two letters he had received. Nancy must never lose
      faith in him; his love was unshaken; before the birth of her child he
      would assuredly be back in England. Let her address to New York. He was
      well, but could not pretend to be very cheerful. However, courage! He had
      plans and hopes, of which she should soon hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Nancy knew nothing of him, save that he was living in New
      York. He wrote two or three times, but briefly, always promising details
      in the next epistle. Then he ceased to correspond. Not even the
      announcement of the child&rsquo;s birth elicited a word from him. One subsequent
      letter had Nancy despatched; this unanswered, she would write no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was herself surprised at the calmness with which she faced so dreadful
      a possibility as desertion by the man she had loved and married, the
      father of her baby. It meant, perhaps, that she could not believe such
      fate had really befallen her. Even in Tarrant&rsquo;s last short letter sounded
      a note of kindness, of truthfulness, incompatible, it seemed to her, with
      base cruelty. &lsquo;I dreamt of you last night, dearest, and woke up with a
      heart that ached for your suffering.&rsquo; How could a man pen those words, and
      be meditating dastardly behaviour to the woman he addressed? Was he ill,
      then? or had fatal accident befallen him? She feared such explanation only
      in her weakest moments. If, long ago, he could keep silence for six weeks
      at a time, why not now for months? As for the news she had sent him&mdash;does
      a man think it important that a little child has been born into the world?
      Likely enough that again he merely &lsquo;postponed&rsquo; writing. Of course he no
      longer loved her, say what he might; at most he thought of her with a
      feeling of compassion&mdash;not strong enough to overcome his dislike of
      exertion. He would come back&mdash;when it pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy would not sully her mind by thinking that he might only return when
      her position made it worth his while. He was not a man of that stamp.
      Simply, he had ceased to care for her; and having no means of his own,
      whilst she was abundantly provided, he yielded to the temptation to hold
      aloof from a woman whose claim upon him grew burdensome. Her thoughts
      admitted no worse accusation than this. Did any grave ill befall her; if,
      for instance, the fact of her marriage became known, and she were left
      helpless; her letter to New York would not be disregarded. To reflect thus
      signified a mental balance rare in women, and remarkable in one situated
      as Nancy was. She talked with her companion far less consistently, for
      talk served to relieve the oppression of her heart and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, next morning, Horace entered the sitting-room, brother and sister
      viewed each other with surprise. Neither was prepared for the outward
      change wrought in both by the past half-year. Nancy looked what she in
      truth had become, a matronly young woman, in uncertain health, and
      possessed by a view of life too grave for her years; Horace, no longer a
      mere lad, exhibited in sunken cheeks and eyes bright with an unhappy
      recklessness, the acquisition of experience which corrupts before it can
      mature. Moving to offer her lips, Nancy was checked by the young man&rsquo;s
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What on earth has been the matter with you? I never saw any one so
      altered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice, with its deepened note, and the modification of his very
      accent, due to novel circumstances, checked the hearer&rsquo;s affectionate
      impulse. If not unfeeling, the utterance had nothing fraternal. Deeply
      pained, and no less alarmed by this warning of the curiosity her
      appearance would excite in all who knew her, Nancy made a faltering reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you seem astonished? You know very well I have had an
      illness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what sort of illness? What caused it? You used always to be well
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better go and talk to my medical attendant,&rsquo; said Nancy, in a
      cold, offended voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace resumed with irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it natural for me to ask such questions? You&rsquo;re not a bit like
      yourself. And what did you mean by telling me you were coming back at
      once, when I wanted to join you at Falmouth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant to. But after all, I had to stay longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh well, it&rsquo;s nothing to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not even shaken hands, and now felt no desire to correct the
      omission, which was at first involuntary. Horace seemed to have lost all
      the amiability of his nature; he looked about him with restless, excited
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you in a hurry?&rsquo; asked his sister, head erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No hurry that I know of.&mdash;You haven&rsquo;t heard what&rsquo;s been going on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t interest you. There&rsquo;s something about you I can&rsquo;t
      understand. Is it father&rsquo;s will that has spoilt your temper, and made you
      behave so strangely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not <i>my</i> temper that&rsquo;s spoilt. And as for behaving strangely&mdash;.&rsquo; 
      She made an effort to command herself. &lsquo;Sit down, Horace, and let me know
      what is the matter with you. Why we should be unfriendly, I really can&rsquo;t
      imagine. I have suffered from ill health, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m sorry I behaved
      in that way when you talked of coming to Falmouth; it wasn&rsquo;t meant as you
      seem to think. Tell me what you have to tell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not take a reposeful attitude, but, after struggling with some
      reluctance, began to explain the agitation that beset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Damerel has done something I didn&rsquo;t think any woman would be capable
      of. For months she has been trying to ruin Fanny, and now it has come&mdash;she
      has succeeded. She made no secret of wanting to break things off between
      her and me, but I never thought her plotting could go as far as this.
      Fanny has run away&mdash;gone to the Continent with a man Mrs. Damerel
      introduced to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps they are married,&rsquo; said Nancy, with singular impulsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they&rsquo;re not. It&rsquo;s a fellow I knew to be a scoundrel the first
      time I set eyes on him. I warned Fanny against him, and I told Mrs.
      Damerel that I should hold her responsible if any harm came of the
      acquaintance she was encouraging between him and Fanny. She did encourage
      it, though she pretended not to. Her aim was to separate me and Fanny&mdash;she
      didn&rsquo;t care how.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a high, vehement note; his cheeks flushed violently, his
      clenched fist quivered at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know where she is gone?&rsquo; Nancy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She as good as told her sister that she was going to Brussels with some
      one. Then one day she disappeared, with her luggage. And that fellow&mdash;Mankelow&rsquo;s
      his name&mdash;has gone too. He lived in the same boarding-house with Mrs.
      Damerel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all the evidence you have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite enough,&rsquo; he replied bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so to me. But suppose you&rsquo;re right, what proof have you
      that Mrs. Damerel had anything to do with it? If she is our mother&rsquo;s
      sister&mdash;and you say there can be no doubt of it&mdash;I won&rsquo;t believe
      that she could carry out such a hateful plot as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it matter who she is? I would swear fifty times that she has
      done it. You know very well, when you saw her, you disliked her at once.
      You were right in that, and I was wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure. Perhaps it was she that disliked me, more than I did
      her. For one thing, I don&rsquo;t believe that people make such plots. And what
      plotting was needed? Couldn&rsquo;t any one have told you what a girl like Fanny
      French would do if she lost her head among people of a higher class?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Mrs. Damerel must have foreseen it. That&rsquo;s just what I say. She
      pretended to be a friend to the girl, on purpose to ruin her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you accused her of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have.&rsquo; His eyes flashed. Nancy marvelled at this fire, drawn from
      a gentle nature by what seemed to her so inadequate, so contemptible a
      cause. &lsquo;Of course she denied it, and got angry with me; but any one could
      see she was glad of what had happened. There&rsquo;s an end between us, at all
      events. I shall never go to see her again; she&rsquo;s a woman who thinks of
      nothing but money and fashion. I dislike her friends, every one of them
      I&rsquo;ve met. I told her that what she had done ought to be a punishable
      crime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy reflected, then said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether you are right or wrong, I don&rsquo;t think you would have got any good
      from her. But will you tell me what you are going to do? I told you that I
      thought borrowing money only to live on it in idleness was very foolish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother stiffened his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must allow me to judge for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But have you judged for yourself? Wasn&rsquo;t it by Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s advice that
      you gave up business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Partly. But I should have done it in any case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any plans?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t expect a man to have plans whose
      life has been thoroughly upset.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, reminded of his youthfulness by the tone in which he called himself
      a &lsquo;man,&rsquo; experienced a revival of natural feeling. Though revolting
      against the suggestion that a woman akin to them had been guilty of what
      her brother believed, she was glad to think that Fanny French had
      relinquished all legitimate claim upon him, and that his connection with
      &lsquo;smart&rsquo; society had come to an end. Obvious enough were the perils of his
      situation, and she, as elder sister, recognised a duty towards him; she
      softened her voice, and endeavoured to re-establish the confidence of old
      time. Impossible at once, though with resolution she might ultimately
      succeed. Horace, at present, was a mere compound of agitated and inflamed
      senses. The life he had been leading appeared in a vicious development of
      his previously harmless conceit and egoism. All his characteristics had
      turned out, as it were, the seamy side; and Nancy with difficulty
      preserved her patience as he showed point after point of perverted
      disposition. The result of their talk was a careless promise from Horace
      that he would come to Grove Lane not seldomer than once a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed only an hour, resisting Nancy&rsquo;s endeavour to detain him at least
      for the mid-day meal. To Mary he spoke formally, awkwardly, as though
      unable to accept her position in the house, and then made his escape like
      one driven by an evil spirit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the clearing of the sky, Nancy&rsquo;s spirit grew lighter. She went about
      London, and enjoyed it after her long seclusion in the little Cornish
      town; enjoyed, too, her release from manifold restraints and perils. Her
      mental suffering had made the physical harder to bear; she was now
      recovering health of mind and body, and found with surprise that life had
      a new savour, independent of the timorous joy born with her child.
      Strangely, as it seemed to her, she grew conscious of a personal freedom
      not unlike what she had vainly desired in the days of petulant girlhood;
      the sense came only at moments, but was real and precious; under its
      influence she forgot everything abnormal in her situation, and&mdash;though
      without recognising this significance&mdash;knew the exultation of a woman
      who has justified her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two of roaming at large gave her an appetite for activity.
      Satisfied that her child was safe and well cared for, she turned her eyes
      upon the life of the world, and wished to take some part in it&mdash;not
      the part she had been wont to picture for herself before reality
      supplanted dreams. Horace&rsquo;s example on the one hand, and that of Jessica
      Morgan on the other, helped her to contemn mere social excitement and the
      idle vanity which formerly she styled pursuit of culture. Must there not
      be discoverable, in the world to which she had, or could obtain, access,
      some honest, strenuous occupation, which would hold in check her
      unprofitable thoughts and soothe her self-respect?
    </p>
    <p>
      That her fraud, up to and beyond the crucial point, had escaped detection,
      must be held so wonderful, that she felt justified in an assurance of
      impunity. The narrowest escape of which she was aware had befallen only a
      few weeks ago. On the sixth day after the birth of the child, there was
      brought to her lodgings at Falmouth a note addressed to &lsquo;Miss. Lord.&rsquo; 
      Letters bearing this address had arrived frequently, and by the people of
      the house were supposed to be for Mary Woodruff, who went by the name of
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord,&rsquo; Nancy having disguised herself as &lsquo;Mrs. Woodruff;&rsquo; but they
      had always come by post, and the present missive must be from some
      acquaintance actually in the town. Nancy could not remember the
      handwriting. Breaking open the envelope as she lay in bed, she saw with
      alarm the signature &lsquo;Luckworth Crewe.&rsquo; He was at Falmouth on business,
      Crewe wrote, and, before leaving London, he had ventured to ask Miss
      Lord&rsquo;s address from her brother, whom he casually met somewhere. Would
      Nancy allow him to see her, were it but for a minute or two? Earnestly he
      besought this favour. He desired nothing more than to see Miss. Lord, and
      to speak with her in the way of an ordinary acquaintance. After all this
      time, she had, he felt sure, forgiven his behaviour at their last meeting.
      Only five minutes of conversation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All seemed lost. Nancy was silent in despair. But Mary faced the perilous
      juncture, and, to all appearances, averted catastrophe. She dressed
      herself, and went straight to the hotel where Crewe had put up, and where
      he awaited an answer. Having made known who she was, she delivered a
      verbal message: Miss. Lord was not well enough to see any one to-day, and,
      in any case, she could not have received Mr Crewe; she begged him to
      pardon her; before long, they might perhaps meet in London, but, for her
      own part, she wished Mr. Crewe would learn to regard her as a stranger. Of
      course there followed a dialogue; and Mary, seeming to speak with all
      freedom, convinced Crewe that his attempt to gain an interview was quite
      hopeless. She gave him much information concerning her mistress&mdash;none
      of it false, but all misleading&mdash;and in the end had to resist an
      offer of gold coins, pressed upon her as a bribe for her good word with
      Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was&mdash;had Crewe been content to leave Falmouth without
      making inquiries of other people? To a man of his experience, nothing was
      easier than such investigation. But, with other grounds of anxiety, this
      had ceased to disturb Nancy&rsquo;s mind. Practically, she lived as though all
      danger were at an end. The task immediately before her seemed very simple;
      she had only to resume the old habits, and guard against thoughtless
      self-betrayal in her everyday talk. The chance that any one would discover
      her habit of visiting a certain house at the distance of several miles
      from Camberwell, was too slight for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote to Mr. Barmby, senior, informing him of her return, in improved
      health, to Grove Lane, and thanking him once more for his allowing her to
      make so long a stay in Cornwall. If he wished to see her, she would be at
      home at any time convenient to him. In a few days the old gentleman
      called, and for an hour or two discoursed well-meaning commonplace. He was
      sorry to observe that she looked a trifle pale; in the autumn she must go
      away again, and to a more bracing locality&mdash;he would suggest
      Broadstairs, which had always exercised the most beneficial effect upon
      his own health. Above all, he begged her to refrain from excessive study,
      most deleterious to a female constitution. Then he asked questions about
      Horace, and agreed with Nancy that the young man ought to decide upon some
      new pursuit, if he had definitely abandoned the old; lack of steady
      occupation was most deleterious at his age. In short, Mr. Barmby rather
      apologised for his guardianship than sought to make assertion of it; and
      Nancy, by a few feminine devices, won a better opinion than she had
      hitherto enjoyed. On the day following, Samuel Barmby and his sisters
      waited upon Miss. Lord; all three were surprisingly solemn, and Samuel
      talked for the most part of a &lsquo;paragraph&rsquo; he had recently read, which
      stated that the smoke of London, if properly utilised, would be worth a
      vast sum of money. &lsquo;The English are a wasteful people,&rsquo; was his
      conclusion; to which Nancy assented with a face as grave as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a little to her astonishment, the next day brought her a long letter
      in Samuel&rsquo;s fair commercial hand. It began by assuring her that the writer
      had no intention whatever of troubling her with the renewal of a suit so
      firmly rejected on more than one occasion; he wished only to take this
      opportunity of her return from a long absence to express the abiding
      nature of his devotion, which years hence would be unbroken as to-day. He
      would never distress her by unwelcome demonstrations; possibly she might
      never again hear from his lips what he now committed to paper. Enough for
      him, Samuel, to cherish a love which could not but exalt and purify him,
      which was indeed, &lsquo;in the words of Shakespeare, &ldquo;a liberal education.&rdquo;&rsquo; In
      recompense of his self-command, he only besought that Miss. Lord would
      allow him, from time to time, to look upon her face, and to converse with
      her of intellectual subjects. &lsquo;A paper,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;which I read last week
      at our Society, is now being printed&mdash;solely at the request of
      friends. The subject is one that may interest you, &ldquo;The Influence of
      Culture on Morality.&rdquo; I beg that you will accept the copy I shall have the
      pleasure of sending you, and that, at some future date, you will honour me
      with your remarks thereon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Which epistle Nancy cruelly read aloud to Mary, with a sprightliness and
      sarcastic humour not excelled by her criticisms of &lsquo;the Prophet&rsquo; in days
      gone by. Mary did not quite understand, but she saw in this behaviour a
      proof of the wonderful courage with which Nancy faced her troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had passed, and no news from America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;Really and truly, I don&rsquo;t care. Yesterday I
      never once thought of it&mdash;never once looked for the postman. The
      worst is over now, and he may write or not, as he likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary felt sure there would be an explanation of such strange silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only illness or death would explain it so as to make me forgive him. But
      he isn&rsquo;t ill. He is alive, and enjoying himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no bitterness in her voice. She seemed to have outlived all
      sorrows and anxieties relative to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary suggested that it was always possible to call at Mr. Vawdrey&rsquo;s house
      and make inquiries of Mrs. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that. Other women would do it, but I won&rsquo;t. So long as I
      mayn&rsquo;t tell the truth, I should only set them talking about me; you know
      how. I see the use, now, of having a good deal of pride. I&rsquo;m only sorry
      for those letters I wrote when I wasn&rsquo;t in my senses. If he writes now, I
      shall not answer. He shall know that I am as independent as he is. What a
      blessed thing it is for a woman to have money of her own! It&rsquo;s because
      most women haven&rsquo;t, that they&rsquo;re such poor, wretched slaves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he knew you were in want,&rsquo; said her companion, &lsquo;he would never have
      behaved like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can say?&mdash;No, I won&rsquo;t pretend to think worse of him than I do.
      You&rsquo;re quite right. He wouldn&rsquo;t leave his wife to starve. It&rsquo;s certain
      that he hears about me from some one. If I were found out, and lost
      everything, some one would let him know. But I wouldn&rsquo;t accept support
      from him, now. He might provide for his child, but he shall never provide
      for me, come what may&mdash;never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the evening, after dinner. Nancy had a newspaper, and was
      reading the advertisements that offered miscellaneous employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think this can be?&rsquo; she asked, looking up after a long
      silence. &lsquo;&ldquo;To ladies with leisure. Ladies desiring to add to their income
      by easy and pleasant work should write&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no faith in those kind of advertisements,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; of course it&rsquo;s rubbish. There&rsquo;s no easy and pleasant way of earning
      money; only silly people expect it. And I don&rsquo;t want anything easy or
      pleasant. I want honest hard work. Not work with my hands&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
      suited for that, but real work, such as lots of educated girls are doing.
      I&rsquo;m quite willing to pay for learning it; most likely I shall have to. Who
      could I write to for advice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting upstairs, and so did not hear a visitor&rsquo;s knock that
      sounded at the front door. The servant came and announced that Miss.
      French wished to see Miss. Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. French? Is it the younger Miss. French?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl could not say; she had repeated the name given to her. Nancy
      spoke to her friend in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be Fanny. I don&rsquo;t think Beatrice would call, unless it&rsquo;s to say
      something about her sister. She had better come up here, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary retired, and in a few moments there entered, not Fanny, but Beatrice.
      She was civilly, not cordially, welcomed. Her eye, as she spoke the words
      natural at such a meeting, dwelt with singular persistency on Nancy&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite well again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been a troublesome illness, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy hesitated, detecting a peculiarity of look and tone which caused her
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had a sort of low fever&mdash;was altogether out of sorts&mdash;&ldquo;below
      par,&rdquo; the doctor said. Are you all well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Settling herself comfortably, as if for a long chat, Beatrice sketched
      with some humour the course of recent events in De Crespigny Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m out of it all, thank goodness. I prefer a quiet life. Then there&rsquo;s
      Fanny. You know all about <i>her</i>, I dare say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; Nancy replied distantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your brother does. Hasn&rsquo;t he been to see you yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was in no mood to submit to examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever I may have heard, I know nothing about Fanny&rsquo;s, affairs, and,
      really, they don&rsquo;t concern me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought they might,&rsquo; rejoined the other, smiling absently.
      &lsquo;She has run away from her friends&rsquo;&mdash;a pause&mdash;&lsquo;and is living
      somewhere rather mysteriously&rsquo;&mdash;another pause&mdash;&lsquo;and I think it
      more than likely that she&rsquo;s <i>married</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener preserved a face of indifference, though the lines were
      decidedly tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that interest you?&rsquo; asked Beatrice, in the most genial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; was the blunt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean, you are glad if she has married somebody else, and not your
      brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am glad of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice mused, with wrinkles at the corner of her eye. Then, fixing Nancy
      with a very keen look, she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that she&rsquo;s married. But if she isn&rsquo;t, no doubt she ought to
      be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On Nancy&rsquo;s part there was a nervous movement, but she said nothing. Her
      face grew rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have an idea who the man is,&rsquo; Miss. French pursued; &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t be
      quite certain. One has heard of similar cases. Even <i>you</i> have, no
      doubt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care to talk about it,&rsquo; fell mechanically from Nancy&rsquo;s lips,
      which had lost their colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve come just for that purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of mocking scrutiny would not be resisted. They drew a gaze from
      Nancy, and then a haughty exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. Please say whatever you have to say in plain
      words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me. You were always too ready at taking offence. I
      mean it in quite a friendly way; you can trust me; I&rsquo;m not one of the
      women that chatter. Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to sympathise a little with
      Fanny? She has gone to Brussels, or somewhere about there. But she <i>might</i>
      have gone down into Cornwall&mdash;to a place like Falmouth. It was quite
      far enough off&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was stricken mute, and her countenance would no longer disguise what
      she suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No need to upset yourself,&rsquo; pursued the other in smiling confidence. &lsquo;I
      mean no harm. I&rsquo;m curious, that&rsquo;s all; just want to know one or two
      things. We&rsquo;re old friends, and whatever you tell me will go no further,
      depend upon that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words came from lips that moved with difficulty. Beatrice, still
      smiling, bent forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it any one that I know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any one&mdash;? Who&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That made it necessary for you to go down into Cornwall, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy heaved a sigh, the result of holding her breath too long. She half
      rose, and sat down again. In a torture of flashing thoughts, she tried to
      determine whether Beatrice had any information, or spoke conjecturally.
      Yet she was able to discern that either case meant disaster; to have
      excited the suspicions of such a person, was the same as being unmasked;
      an inquiry at Falmouth, and all would at once be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not all. Not the fact of her marriage; not the name of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven to bay by such an opponent, she assumed an air wholly unnatural to
      her&mdash;one of cynical effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better say what you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Who was the father of the child born not long ago?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s asking a question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And telling what I know at the same time. It saves breath.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice laughed; and Nancy, become a mere automaton, laughed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rsquo; said Miss. French cheerfully. &lsquo;Now we shall get on
      together. It&rsquo;s very shocking, my dear. A person of my strict morality
      hardly knows how to look you in the face. Perhaps you had rather I didn&rsquo;t
      try. Very well. Now tell me all about it, comfortably. I have a guess, you
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little. I don&rsquo;t want to be laughed at. Is it any one I know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never seen him, and I dare say never heard of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice stared incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell fibs, Nancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very queer, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who did you think&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaking automaton, as though by defect of mechanism, stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look straight at me. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised to hear that it was
      Luckworth Crewe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s defiant gaze, shame in anguish shielding itself with the front of
      audacity, changed to utter astonishment. The blood rushed back into her
      cheeks; she voiced a smothered exclamation of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The father of my child? Luckworth Crewe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it not impossible,&rsquo; said Beatrice, plainly baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was like you.&rsquo; Nancy gave a hard laugh. &lsquo;You judged me by yourself.
      Have another guess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised both at the denial, so obviously true, and at the unexpected
      tone with which Nancy was meeting her attack, Miss. French sat meditative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use guessing,&rsquo; she said at length, with complete good-humour. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know of any one else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. You can&rsquo;t expect me to tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please. It&rsquo;s a queer thing; I felt pretty sure. But if you&rsquo;re
      telling the truth, I don&rsquo;t care a rap who the man is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can rest in peace,&rsquo; said Nancy, with careless scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any way of convincing me, except by saying it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Wait here a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room, and returned with the note which Crewe had addressed to
      her from the hotel at Falmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read that, and look at the date.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice studied the document, and in silence canvassed the possibilities
      of trickery. No; it was genuine evidence. She remembered the date of
      Crewe&rsquo;s journey to Falmouth, and, in this new light, could interpret his
      quarrelsome behaviour after he had returned. Only the discovery she had
      since made inflamed her with a suspicion which till then had never entered
      her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, you didn&rsquo;t let him see you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not.&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t suppose I wanted to insult you. I took it for granted
      you were married. Of course it happened before your father&rsquo;s death, and
      his awkward will obliged you to keep it dark?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Nancy was smitten with fear. Deeming Miss. French an unscrupulous
      enemy, she felt that to confess marriage was to abandon every hope. Pride
      appealed to her courage, bade her, here and now, have done with the
      ignoble fraud; but fear proved stronger. She could not face exposure, and
      all that must follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke coldly, but with down-dropt eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words cost her little effort. Practically, she had uttered them
      before; her overbold replies were an admission of what, from the first,
      she supposed Beatrice to charge her with&mdash;not secret wedlock, but
      secret shame. Beatrice, however, had adopted that line of suggestion
      merely from policy, hoping to sting the proud girl into avowal of a
      legitimate union; she heard the contrary declaration with fresh surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should never have believed it of Miss. Lord,&rsquo; was her half ingenuous,
      half sly comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, beginning to realise what she had done, sat with head bent,
      speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself,&rsquo; continued the other. &lsquo;Not a soul will hear of
      it from me. If you like to tell me more, you can do it quite safely; I&rsquo;m
      no blabber, and I&rsquo;m not a rascal. I should never have troubled to make
      inquiries about you, down yonder, if it hadn&rsquo;t been that I suspected
      Crewe. That&rsquo;s a confession, you know; take it in return for yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was tongue-tied. A full sense of her humiliation had burst upon her.
      She, who always condescended to Miss. French, now lay smirched before her
      feet, an object of vulgar contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; went on Beatrice genially. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got over the
      worst, and very cleverly. Are you going to marry him when you come in for
      your money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered, no longer able to mask in impudence, and hardly restraining
      tears. Beatrice ceased to doubt, and could only wonder with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be good friends, Nancy? I tell you, I am no rascal. I
      never thought of making anything out of your secret&mdash;not I. If it had
      been Crewe, marriage or no marriage&mdash;well, I might have shown my
      temper. I believe I have a pretty rough side to my tongue; but I&rsquo;m a good
      enough sort if you take me in the right way. Of course I shall never rest
      for wondering who it can be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, but Nancy did not look up, did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me some other time. But there&rsquo;s one thing I should
      like to ask about, and it&rsquo;s for your own good that I should know it. When
      Crewe was down there, don&rsquo;t you think he tumbled to anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed by unfamiliar slang, Nancy raised her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Found out anything, you mean? I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you must have been in a jolly fright about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gave it very little thought,&rsquo; replied Nancy, able now to command a
      steady voice, and retiring behind a manner of frigid indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No? Well, of course I understand that better now I know that you can&rsquo;t
      lose anything. Still, it is to be hoped he didn&rsquo;t go asking questions.
      By-the-bye, you may as well just tell me: he has asked you to marry him,
      hasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid, even if he got hold of anything.
      He isn&rsquo;t the kind of man to injure you out of spite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear him as little as I fear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as I&rsquo;ve told you, you needn&rsquo;t fear me at all. I like you better for
      this&mdash;a good deal better than I used to. If you want any help, you
      know where to turn; I&rsquo;ll do whatever I can for you; and I&rsquo;m in the way of
      being useful to my friends. You&rsquo;re cut up just now; it&rsquo;s natural. I won&rsquo;t
      bother you any longer. But just remember what I&rsquo;ve said. If I can be of
      any service, don&rsquo;t be above making use of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy heard without heeding; for an anguish of shame and misery once more
      fell upon her, and seemed to lay waste her soul.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      There needed not Mary Woodruff&rsquo;s suggestion to remind Nancy that no
      further away than Champion Hill were people of whom, in extremity, she
      might inquire concerning her husband. At present, even could she have
      entertained the thought, it seemed doubtful whether the Vawdrey household
      knew more of Tarrant&rsquo;s position and purposes than she herself; for, only a
      month ago, Jessica Morgan had called upon the girls and had ventured a
      question about their cousin, whereupon they answered that he was in
      America, but that he had not written for a long time. To Mrs. Baker,
      Jessica did not like to speak on the subject, but probably that lady could
      have answered only as the children did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, indeed, a few days after her return, Nancy took the familiar walk
      along Champion Hill, and glanced, in passing, at Mr. Vawdrey&rsquo;s house;
      afterwards, she shunned that region. The memories it revived were
      infinitely painful. She saw herself an immature and foolish girl, behaving
      in a way which, for all its affectation of reserve and dignity, no doubt
      offered to such a man as Lionel Tarrant a hint that here, if he chose, he
      might make a facile conquest. Had he not acted upon the hint? It wrung her
      heart with shame to remember how, in those days, she followed the lure of
      a crude imagination. A year ago? Oh, a lifetime!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling, now, to justify herself with the plea of love; doubtful, in
      very truth, whether her passion merited that name; she looked back in the
      stern spirit of a woman judging another&rsquo;s frailty. What treatment could
      she have anticipated at the hands of her lover save that she had received?
      He married her&mdash;it was much; he forsook her&mdash;it was natural. The
      truth of which she had caught troublous glimpses in the heyday of her
      folly now stood revealed as pitiless condemnation. Tarrant never respected
      her, never thought of her as a woman whom he could seriously woo and wed.
      She had a certain power over his emotions, and not the sensual alone; but
      his love would not endure the test of absence. From the other side of the
      Atlantic he saw her as he had seen her at first, and shrank from returning
      to the bondage which in a weak moment he had accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night about this time she said to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was his mistress, never his wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And all her desperate endeavours to obscure the history of their love, to
      assert herself as worthy to be called wife, mother, had fallen fruitless.
      Those long imploring letters, despatched to America from her solitude by
      the Cornish sea, elicited nothing but a word or two which sounded more
      like pity than affection. Pity does not suffice to recall the wandering
      steps of a man wedded against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her heart, she absolved him of all baseness. The man of ignoble thought
      would have been influenced by her market value as a wife. Tarrant, all the
      more because he was reduced to poverty, would resolutely forget the crude
      advantage of remaining faithful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herein Nancy proved herself more akin to her father than she had ever
      seemed when Stephen Lord sought eagerly in her character for hopeful
      traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severity of her self-judgment, and the indulgence tempering her
      attitude towards Tarrant, declared a love which had survived its phase of
      youthful passion. But Nancy did not recognise this symptom of moral
      growth. She believed herself to have become indifferent to her husband,
      and only wondered that she did not hate him. Her heart seemed to spend all
      its emotion on the little being to whom she had given life&mdash;a healthy
      boy, who already, so she fancied, knew a difference between his mother and
      his nurse, and gurgled a peculiar note of contentment when lying in her
      arms. Whether wife or not, she claimed every privilege of motherhood. Had
      the child been a weakling, she could not have known this abounding solace:
      the defect would have reproached her. But from the day of his birth he
      manifested so vigorous a will to live, clung so hungrily to the
      fountain-breast, kicked and clamoured with such irresistible
      self-assertion, that the mother&rsquo;s pride equalled her tenderness. &lsquo;My own
      brave boy! My son!&rsquo; Wonderful new words: honey upon the lips and rapture
      to the ear. She murmured them as though inspired with speech never uttered
      by mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval of a day between her journeys to see the child taxed her
      patience; but each visit brought a growth of confidence. No harm would
      befall him: Mary had chosen wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace kept aloof and sent no message. When at length she wrote to him a
      letter all of sisterly kindness, there came a stinted reply. He said that
      he was going away for a holiday, and might be absent until September.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about me. You shall hear again before long. There&rsquo;s just a
      chance that I may go in for business again, with prospect of making money.
      Particulars when I see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy found this note awaiting her after a day&rsquo;s absence from home, and
      with it another. To her surprise, Mrs. Damerel had written. &lsquo;I called
      early this afternoon, wishing particularly to see you. Will you please let
      me know when I should find you at home? It is about Horace that I want to
      speak.&rsquo; It began with &lsquo;My dear Nancy,&rsquo; and ended, &lsquo;Yours affectionately.&rsquo; 
      Glad of the opportunity thus offered, she answered at once, making an
      appointment for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Damerel came, Nancy was even more struck than at their former
      meeting with her resemblance to Horace. Eyes and lips recalled Horace at
      every moment. This time, the conversation began more smoothly. On both
      sides appeared a disposition to friendliness, though Nancy only marked her
      distrust in the hope of learning more about this mysterious relative and
      of being useful to her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a prejudice against me,&rsquo; said the visitor, when she had inquired
      concerning Nancy&rsquo;s health. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only natural. I hardly seem to you a real
      relative, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;you know so little about me; and now Horace has
      been laying dreadful things to my charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thinks you responsible for what has happened to Fanny French,&rsquo; Nancy
      replied, in an impartial voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and I assure you he is mistaken. Miss. French deceived him and her
      own people, leading them to think that she was spending her time with me,
      when really she was&mdash;who knows where? To you I am quite ready to
      confess that I hoped something might come between her and Horace; but as
      for plotting&mdash;really lam not so melodramatic a person. All I did in
      the way of design was to give Horace an opportunity of seeing the girl in
      a new light. You can imagine very well, no doubt, how she conducted
      herself. I quite believe that Horace was getting tired and ashamed of her,
      but then came her disappearance, and that made him angry with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the voice suggested Horace&rsquo;s tones, especially when softened in
      familiar dialogue. Nancy paid closer attention to the speaker&rsquo;s looks and
      movements than to the matter of what she said. Mrs. Damerel might possibly
      be a well-meaning woman&mdash;her peculiarities might result from social
      habits, and not from insincerity; yet Nancy could not like her. Everything
      about her prompted a question and a doubt. How old was she? Probably much
      older than she looked. What was her breeding, her education? Probably far
      less thorough than she would have one believe. Was she in good
      circumstances? Nancy suspected that her fashionable and expensive dress
      signified extravagance and vanity rather than wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have brought a letter to show you which she has sent me from abroad.
      Read it, and form your own conclusion. Is it the letter of an injured
      innocent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A scrawl on foreign note-paper, which ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MRS DAMEREL,&mdash;Just a word to console you for the loss of my
      society. I have gone to a better world, so dry your tears. If you see my
      masher, tell him I&rsquo;ve met with somebody a bit more like a man. I should
      advise him to go to school again and finish his education. I won&rsquo;t trouble
      you to write. Many thanks for the kindness you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> mean to do
      me.&mdash;Yours in the best of spirits (I don&rsquo;t mean Cognac),
    </p>
    <p>
      FANNY (<i>nee</i>) FRENCH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy returned the paper with a look of disgust, saying, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
      she was as bad as that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more did I. It really gave me a little shock of surprise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think it likely she is married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel pursed her lips and arched her eyebrows with so unpleasant an
      effect on Nancy that she looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no means whatever of forming an opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s no more fear for Horace,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not&mdash;I think not. But my purpose in coming was to consult
      with you about the poor boy. He has renounced me; he won&rsquo;t answer my
      letters; and I am so dreadfully afraid that a sort of despair&mdash;it
      sounds ridiculous, but he is so very young&mdash;may drive him into
      reckless living. You have taken part with him against me, I fear&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I told him I was quite sure the girl had only herself to
      blame, whatever happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How kind of you!&rsquo; Mrs. Damerel sank her voice to a sort of cooing, not
      unmelodious, but to Nancy&rsquo;s ear a hollow affectation. &lsquo;If we could
      understand each other! I am so anxious for your dear brother&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;and
      for yours, believe me. I have suffered greatly since he told me I was his
      enemy, and cast me off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here sounded a note of pathos which impressed the critical listener. There
      was a look, too, in Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s eyes quite unlike any that Nancy had
      yet detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you wish him to do?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;If I must tell you the truth, I
      don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll get any good in the life of society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Society&rsquo;s representative answered in a tone of affectionate frankness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t; I can see that. I don&rsquo;t wish him to live idly. The question is,
      What ought he to do? I think you know a gentleman of his acquaintance, Mr.
      Crewe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was added rather abruptly, and with a watchful gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know him a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something has been said, I believe, about Horace investing money in Mr.
      Crewe&rsquo;s business. Do you think it would be advisable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise kept Nancy silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Crewe trustworthy? I understand he has been in business for
      himself only a short time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy declared herself unable to judge Mr. Crewe, whether in private or in
      commercial life. And here she paused, but could not refrain from adding
      the question whether Mrs. Damerel had personal knowledge of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have met him once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, all Nancy&rsquo;s suspicions were revived. She had felt a desire to
      talk of intimate things, with mention of her mother&rsquo;s name; but the
      repulsion excited in her by this woman&rsquo;s air of subtlety, by looks,
      movements, tones which she did not understand, forbade it. She could not
      speak with satisfaction even of Horace, feeling that Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s
      affection, however genuine, must needs be baleful. From this point her
      part in the dialogue was slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If any of Miss. French&rsquo;s relatives,&rsquo; said the visitor presently, &lsquo;should
      accuse me to you, you will be able to contradict them. I am sure I can
      depend upon you for that service?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not likely to see them; and I should have thought you would care
      very little what was said about you by people of that kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I care little enough,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Damerel, with a curl of the lips.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Horace I am thinking of. These people will embitter him against me,
      so long as they have any ground to go upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But haven&rsquo;t you let him know of that letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel seemed to fall into abstraction, answered with a vague &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; 
      and after surveying the room, said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you must live here alone for another two or three years?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t compulsory: it&rsquo;s only a condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another vague &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do so wish Horace would come back and make his home here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have spoilt him for that,&rsquo; said Nancy, with relief in this
      piece of plain speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel did not openly resent it. She looked a mild surprise, and
      answered blandly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I must undo the mischief. You shall help me. When he has got over
      this little trouble, he will see who are his true friends. Let us work
      together for his good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was inclined, once more, to reproach herself, and listened with
      patience whilst her relative continued talking in grave kindly tones. Lest
      she should spoil the effect of these impressive remarks, Mrs. Damerel then
      took leave. In shaking hands, she bent upon the girl a gaze of affection,
      and, as she turned away, softly sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what had passed in the recent interview with Beatrice French, Nancy
      said nothing to her faithful companion. This burden of shame must be borne
      by herself alone. It affected profoundly the courageous mood which had
      promised to make her life tolerable; henceforth, she all but abandoned the
      hope of gaining that end for which she had submitted to so deep a
      humiliation. Through Beatrice, would not her secret, coloured shamefully,
      become known to Luckworth Crewe, and to others? Already, perchance, a
      growing scandal attached to her name. Fear had enabled her to endure
      dishonour in the eyes of one woman, but at any moment the disgrace might
      front her in an intolerable shape; then, regardless of the cost, she would
      proclaim her marriage, and have, in return for all she had suffered,
      nothing but the reproach of an attempted fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find employment, means of honourable support, was an urgent necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written in reply to sundry advertisements, but without result. She
      tried to draw up an advertisement on her own account, but found the
      difficulty insuperable. What was there she could do? Teach children,
      perhaps; but as a visiting governess, the only position of the kind which
      circumstances left open to her, she could hope for nothing more than the
      paltriest remuneration. Be somebody&rsquo;s &lsquo;secretary&rsquo;? That sounded pleasant,
      but very ambitious: a sense of incompetency chilled her. In an office, in
      a shop, who would dream of giving her an engagement?
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking about the streets of London in search of suggestions, she gained
      only an understanding of her insignificance. In the battle of life every
      girl who could work a sewing-machine or make a matchbox was of more
      account than she. If she entered a shop to make purchases, the young women
      at the counter seemed to smile superiority. Of what avail her &lsquo;education,&rsquo; 
      her &lsquo;culture&rsquo;? The roar of myriad industries made mocking laughter at such
      futile pretensions. She shrank back into her suburban home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little book on &lsquo;employments for women,&rsquo; which she saw advertised and
      bought, merely heightened her discouragement. Here, doubtless, were
      occupations she might learn; but, when it came to choosing, and
      contemplating the practical steps that must be taken, her heart sank. She
      was a coward; she dreaded the world; she saw as never yet the blessedness
      of having money and a secure home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &lsquo;home&rsquo; grew very sweet to her ears. A man, she said to herself,
      may go forth and find his work, his pleasure, in the highways; but is not
      a woman&rsquo;s place under the sheltering roof? What right had a mother to be
      searching abroad for tasks and duties? Task enough, duty obvious, in the
      tending of her child. Had she but a little country cottage with needs
      assured, and her baby cradled beside her, she would ask no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      How idle all the thoughts of her girlhood! How little she knew of life as
      it would reveal itself to her mature eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigued into listlessness, she went to the lending-library, and chose a
      novel for an hour&rsquo;s amusement. It happened that this story was concerned
      with the fortunes of a young woman who, after many an affliction sore,
      discovered with notable suddenness the path to fame, lucre, and the
      husband of her heart: she became at a bound a successful novelist. Nancy&rsquo;s
      cheek flushed with a splendid thought. Why should not <i>she</i> do
      likewise? At all events&mdash;for modesty was now her ruling
      characteristic&mdash;why should she not earn a little money by writing
      Stories? Numbers of women took to it; not a few succeeded. It was a
      pursuit that demanded no apprenticeship, that could be followed in the
      privacy of home, a pursuit wherein her education would be of service. With
      imagination already fired by the optimistic author, she began to walk
      about the room and devise romantic incidents. A love story, of course&mdash;and
      why not one very like her own? The characters were ready to her hands. She
      would begin this very evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary saw the glow upon her face, the delightful frenzy in her eyes, and
      wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have an idea,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me about it. Just leave me alone.
      I think I see my way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily she secluded herself for several hours; and, whatever the literary
      value of her labour, it plainly kept her in good spirits, and benefited
      her health. Save for the visits to her baby, regular as before, she hardly
      left home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica Morgan came very often, much oftener than Nancy desired; not only
      was her talk wearisome, but it consumed valuable time. She much desired to
      see the baby, and Nancy found it difficult to invent excuses for her
      unwillingness. When importunity could not be otherwise defeated, she
      pretended a conscientious scruple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have deceived my husband in telling him that no one knows of our
      marriage but Mary. If I let you see the child, I should feel that I was
      deceiving him again. Don&rsquo;t ask me; I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unnaturally this struck Jessica as far-fetched. She argued against it,
      and became petulant. Nancy lost patience, but remembered in time that she
      was at Jessica&rsquo;s mercy, and, to her mortification, had to adopt a coaxing,
      almost a suppliant, tone, with the result that Miss. Morgan&rsquo;s overweening
      conceit was flattered into arrogance. Her sentimental protestations became
      strangely mixed with a self-assertiveness very galling to Nancy&rsquo;s pride.
      Without the slightest apparent cause for ill-humour, she said one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do feel sorry for you; it must be a dreadful thing to have married a
      man who has no sense of honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy fired up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can he have, when he makes you deceive people in this way for the
      sake of the money he&rsquo;ll get?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s my own choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he oughtn&rsquo;t let you do it. No honourable man would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That has nothing to do with you,&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed, anger blanching her
      cheek. &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk about my husband. You say things you ought to be
      ashamed of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be angry!&rsquo; The facile tears started in Jessica&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      because I feel indignant on your account, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your indignation. Never mention this subject again, or I
      shall feel sure you do it on purpose to annoy me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica melted into mawkishness; none the less, Nancy felt a slave to her
      former friend, who, for whatever reason, seemed to have grown hypocritical
      and spiteful. When next the girl called, she was told that Miss. Lord had
      left home for the day, a fiction which spared Nancy an hour&rsquo;s torment.
      Miss. Morgan made up for it by coming very early on the next Sunday
      afternoon, and preparing herself avowedly for a stay until late in the
      evening. Resolute to avoid a long <i>tete-a-tete</i>, which was sure to
      exasperate her temper, Nancy kept Mary in the room, and listened to no
      hint from Jessica that they should retire for the accustomed privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock they were joined by Samuel Barmby, whom, for once, Nancy
      welcomed with pleasure. Samuel, who had come in the hope of finding Miss.
      Lord alone, gave but the coldest attention to Jessica; Mary, however, he
      greeted with grave courtesy, addressing to her several remarks which were
      meant as a recognition of social equality in the quondam servant. He was
      dressed with elaborate care. Snowy cuffs concealed half his hands; his
      moustache, of late in training, sketched the graceful curl it would
      presently achieve; a faint perfume attended the drawing forth of his silk
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel never lacked a subject for the display of eloquence. Today it was
      one that called for indignant fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most disgraceful fact has come under my notice, and I am sorry to say,
      Miss. Lord, that it concerns some one with whom you are acquainted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Nancy, not without tremor. &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Peachey, of De Crespigny Park. I believe you are on terms of
      friendship with the family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you can hardly call it friendship. I know them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I may speak without fear of paining you. You are aware that Mr
      Peachey is a member of the firm of Ducker, Blunt &amp; Co., who
      manufacture disinfectants. Now, if any manufacture should be carried on in
      a conscientious spirit&mdash;as of course <i>all</i> manufactures should&mdash;surely
      it is that of disinfectants. Only think what depends upon it! People who
      make disinfectants ought to regard themselves as invested with a sacred
      trust. The whole community looks to them for protection against disease.
      The abuse of such confidence cannot be too severely condemned, all the
      more so, that there is absolutely no legal remedy against the adulteration
      of disinfectants. Did you know that, Miss. Lord? The law guards against
      adulteration of food, but it seems&mdash;I have been making inquiry into
      the matter&mdash;that no thought has ever been given by the legislature to
      the subject of disinfectants!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy saw that Jessica was watching the speaker with jealous eyes, and, in
      spite of prudence, she could not help behaving to Mr. Barmby more
      graciously than usual; a small revenge for the treatment she had suffered
      at the hands of Miss. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could point out a great number of such anomalies,&rsquo; pursued Samuel. &lsquo;But
      this matter of disinfectants is really one of the gravest. My father has
      written to <i>The Times</i> about it, and his letter will probably be
      inserted to-morrow. I am thinking of bringing it before the attention of
      our Society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do Mr. Peachey&rsquo;s people adulterate their disinfectants?&rsquo; inquired Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to tell you. Some acquaintances of ours have had a severe
      illness in their house, and have been using disinfectants made by Ducker,
      Blunt &amp; Co. Fortunately they have a very good medical man, and through
      him it has been discovered that these pretended safeguards are all but
      absolutely worthless. He had the stuff analysed. Now, isn&rsquo;t this shameful?
      Isn&rsquo;t this abominable? For my own part, I should call it constructive
      murder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase came by haphazard to Samuel&rsquo;s tongue, and he uttered it with
      gusto, repeating it twice or thrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Constructive murder&mdash;nothing short of that. And to think that these
      people enjoy a positive immunity&mdash;impunity.&rsquo; He corrected himself
      quickly; then, uncertain whether he had really made a mistake, reddened
      and twisted his gloves. &lsquo;To think&rsquo;&mdash;he raised his voice&mdash;&lsquo;that
      they are capable of making money out of disease and death! It is one of
      the worst illustrations of a corrupt spirit in the commercial life of our
      times that has yet come under my observation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained for a couple of hours, talking ceaselessly. A glance which he
      now and then cast at Miss. Morgan betrayed his hope that she would take
      her leave before the necessary time of his own departure. Jessica,
      perfectly aware of this desire, sat as though no less at home than Nancy.
      Every remark she made was a stroke of malice at her friend, and in her
      drawn features appeared the passions by which she was tormented.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mr. Barmby had regretfully withdrawn, Nancy turned upon the
      girl with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to speak to you. Come downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the dining-room. Jessica followed without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you behaving like this? What has come to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeble anaemic creature fell back before this outbreak of wholesome
      wrath; her eyes stared in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t put up with it,&rsquo; cried Nancy. &lsquo;If you think you can insult me
      because I trusted you when you were my only friend, you&rsquo;ll find your
      mistake. A little more, and you shall see how little your power over me is
      worth. Am I to live at <i>your</i> mercy! I&rsquo;d starve rather. What do you
      mean by it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;Nancy&mdash;to think you should speak to me like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are to be allowed to spit poison at me&mdash;are you? And I must bear
      it? No, that I won&rsquo;t! Of course I know what&rsquo;s the matter with you. You
      have fallen in love with Samuel Barmby.&mdash;You have! Any one can see
      it. You have no more command of yourself than a child. And because he
      prefers me to you, you rage against me. Idiot! What is Samuel Barmby to
      me? Can I do more to keep him off? Can I say to him, &ldquo;Do have pity on poor
      Miss. Morgan, who&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by a scream, on which followed a torrent of frenzied
      words from Jessica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a bad-hearted woman! You&rsquo;ve behaved disgracefully yourself&mdash;oh!
      I know more than you think; and now you accuse me of being as bad. Why did
      you get married in such a hurry? Do you think I didn&rsquo;t understand it? It&rsquo;s
      you who have no command over yourself. If the truth were known, no decent
      woman would ever speak to You again. And you&rsquo;ve got your reward. Pretend
      as you like, I know your husband has deserted you. What else could you
      expect? That&rsquo;s what makes you hate every one that hasn&rsquo;t fallen into the
      mud. I wouldn&rsquo;t have such a character as yours! All this afternoon you&rsquo;ve
      been looking at that man as no married woman could who respected herself.
      You encourage him; he comes here often&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hysterical passion strangled her voice, and before she could recover
      breath, Nancy, terrible in ire, advanced upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave this house, and never dare to show yourself here again! Do what you
      like, I&rsquo;ll endure you no longer&mdash;be off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica retreated, her bloodless lips apart, her eyes starting as in
      suffocation. She stumbled against a chair, fell to the ground, and, with a
      cry of anguish, threw herself upon her knees before Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did I say? I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I have been
      saying&mdash;it was all madness. Oh, do forgive me! That isn&rsquo;t how I
      really think of you&mdash;you know it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so wicked as
      that. We have been friends so long&mdash;I must have gone mad to speak
      such words. Don&rsquo;t drive me away from you, dear, dear Nancy! I implore you
      to forgive me! Look, I pray to you on my knees to forget it. Despise me
      for being such a weak, wicked creature, but don&rsquo;t drive me away like that!
      I didn&rsquo;t mean one word I said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rubbish! Of course you meant it. You have thought it every day, and
      you&rsquo;ll say it again, behind my back, if not to my face. Stand up, and
      don&rsquo;t make yourself sillier than you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t call me anything too bad&mdash;but don&rsquo;t drive me away. I can&rsquo;t
      bear it. You are the only friend I have in the world&mdash;the only, only
      friend. No one was ever kind and good to me but you, and this is how I
      have repaid you. Oh, I hate myself! I could tear my tongue out for saying
      such things. Only say that you&rsquo;ll try to forgive me&mdash;dear Nancy&mdash;dear&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell with face upon the carpet, and grovelled there in anguish of
      conflicting passions, a lamentable object. Unable to bear the sight of
      her, Nancy moved away, and stood with back turned, perforce hearing the
      moans and sobs and half-articulate words which lasted until the fit of
      hysteria left its victim in mute exhaustion. Then, contemptuously pitiful,
      she drew near again to the prostrate figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand up at once, and let us have an end of this vulgar folly. Stand up,
      or I&rsquo;ll leave you here, and never speak to you again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy&mdash;can you forgive me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you have never got over your illness. If I were you, I should
      see the doctor again, and try to be cured. You&rsquo;ll end in an asylum, if you
      don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I often feel almost mad&mdash;I do really. Will you forget those dreadful
      words I spoke? I know you can&rsquo;t forgive me at once&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only stand up, and try to behave like a reasonable being. What do I care
      for your words?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised herself, threw her arms over a chair, and wept miserably.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      On an afternoon at the end of October, Samuel Barmby, returned from
      business, found Miss. Morgan having tea with his sisters. For a month or
      two after Midsummer the Barmbys had scarcely seen her; now their friendly
      intercourse was renewed, and Jessica came at least once a week. She had an
      engagement at a girls&rsquo; school in this neighbourhood, and, though her
      health threatened another collapse, she talked of resuming study for the
      Matriculation of next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel, perfectly aware of the slavish homage which Miss. Morgan paid him,
      took pleasure in posing before her. It never entered his mind to make any
      return beyond genial patronage, but the incense of a female devotee was
      always grateful to him, and he had come to look upon Jessica as a young
      person peculiarly appreciative of intellectual distinction. A week ago,
      walking with her to the omnibus after an evening she had spent in Dagmar
      Road, he had indulged a spirit of confidence, and led her to speak of
      Nancy Lord. The upshot of five minutes&rsquo; conversation was a frank inquiry,
      which he could hardly have permitted himself but for the shadow of night
      and the isolating noises around them. As an intimate friend, did she feel
      able to tell him whether or not Miss. Lord was engaged to be married?
      Jessica, after a brief silence, answered that she did <i>not</i> feel at
      liberty to disclose what she knew on the subject; but the words she used,
      and her voice in uttering them, left no doubt as to her meaning. Samuel
      said no more. At parting, he pressed the girl&rsquo;s hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, they began by avoiding each other&rsquo;s look. Samuel seemed
      indisposed for conversation; he sipped at a cup of tea with an abstracted
      and somewhat weary air, until Miss. Morgan addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow is the evening of your lecture, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Barmby?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By the agency of a friend who belonged to a society of mutual improvement
      at Pentonville, Samuel had been invited to go over and illumine with his
      wisdom the seekers after culture in that remote district, a proposal that
      flattered him immensely, and inspired him with a hope of more than
      suburban fame. For some months he had spoken of the engagement. He was to
      discourse upon &lsquo;National Greatness: its Obligations and its Dangers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it will be printed afterwards?&rsquo; pursued the devotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s hardly worth that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it will be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jessica appealed to the sisters, who declared that certain passages
      they had been privileged to hear seemed to them very remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladies were to be admitted, but the Miss. Barmbys felt afraid to undertake
      so long a journey after dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know some one who would very much like to go,&rsquo; said Jessica, steadying
      her voice. &lsquo;Could you spare me a ticket to give away, Mr Barmby?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel smiled graciously, and promised the ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was for Jessica&rsquo;s own use. On the following evening, long
      before the hour which would have allowed her ample time to reach
      Pentonville by eight o&rsquo;clock, she set forth excitedly. Unless Samuel
      Barmby were accompanied by some friend from Camberwell,&mdash;only too
      probable,&mdash;she might hope to make the return journey under his
      protection. Perhaps he would speak again of Nancy Lord, and this time he
      should be answered with less reserve. What harm if she even told him the
      name of the man whom Nancy was &lsquo;engaged&rsquo; to marry?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was no longer her friend. A show of reconciliation had followed that
      scene on the Sunday afternoon three months ago; but Jessica well knew that
      she had put herself beyond forgiveness, nor did she desire it. Even
      without the memory of her offence, by this time she must needs have
      regarded Nancy with steadfast dislike. Weeks had gone by since their last
      meeting, which was rendered so unpleasant by mutual coldness that a
      renewal of intercourse seemed out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not be guilty of treachery. But, in justice to herself, she
      might give Samuel Barmby to understand how hopeless was his wooing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her disappointment, the lecture-room was small and undignified; she had
      imagined a capacious hall, with Samuel Bennett Barmby standing up before
      an audience of several hundred people. The cane-bottomed chairs numbered
      not more than fifty, and at eight o&rsquo;clock some of them were still
      unoccupied. Nor did the assembly answer to her expectation. It seemed to
      consist of young shopmen, with a few females of their kind interspersed.
      She chose a place in the middle of the room, where the lecturer could
      hardly fail to observe her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Barmby&rsquo;s entrance disillusion gave way before the ardours of flesh
      and spirit. The whole hour through she never took her eyes from him. His
      smooth, pink face, with its shining moustache, embodied her ideal of manly
      beauty; his tall figure inflamed her senses; the words that fell from his
      lips sounded to her with oracular impressiveness, conveying a wisdom
      before which she bowed, and a noble enthusiasm to which she responded in
      fervent exaltation. And she had been wont to ridicule this man, to join in
      mockery of his eloquence with a conceited wanton such as Nancy Lord! No,
      it never came from her heart; it was moral cowardice; from the first she
      had recognised Samuel Barmby&rsquo;s infinite superiority to the ignoble, the
      impure girl who dared to deride him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her; their eyes met once, and again, and yet again. He knew that
      she alone in the audience could comprehend his noble morality, grasp the
      extent of his far-sighted speculations. To her he spoke. And in his deep
      glowing heart he could not but thank her for such evidence of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a tedious debate, a muddy flow of gabble and balderdash. It
      was over by ten o&rsquo;clock. With jealous eyes she watched her hero surrounded
      by people who thought, poor creatures, that they were worthy of offering
      him congratulations. At a distance she lingered. And behold, his eye once
      more fell upon her! He came out from among the silly chatterers, and
      walked towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You played me a trick, Miss. Morgan. I should never have allowed you to
      come all this way to hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had come ten times the distance, I should have been repaid!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His round eyes gloated upon the flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, I mustn&rsquo;t pretend that I think the lecture worthless. But you
      might have had the manuscript to read. Are you quite alone? Then I must
      take care of you. It&rsquo;s a wretched night; we&rsquo;ll have a cab to King&rsquo;s
      Cross.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it with a consciousness of large-handed generosity. Jessica&rsquo;s
      heart leapt and throbbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was by his side in the vehicle. Her body touched his. She felt his
      warm breath as he talked. In all too short a time they reached the railway
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you come this way? Have you a ticket? Leave that to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again largely generous, he strode to the booking-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended and stood together upon the platform, among hurrying
      crowds, in black fumes that poisoned the palate with sulphur. This way and
      that sped the demon engines, whirling lighted waggons full of people.
      Shrill whistles, the hiss and roar of steam, the bang, clap, bang of
      carriage-doors, the clatter of feet on wood and stone&mdash;all echoed and
      reverberated from a huge cloudy vault above them. High and low, on every
      available yard of wall, advertisements clamoured to the eye: theatres,
      journals, soaps, medicines, concerts, furniture, wines, prayer-meetings&mdash;all
      the produce and refuse of civilisation announced in staring letters, in
      daubed effigies, base, paltry, grotesque. A battle-ground of
      advertisements, fitly chosen amid subterranean din and reek; a symbol to
      the gaze of that relentless warfare which ceases not, night and day, in
      the world above.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the southward train they had to wait ten minutes. Jessica, keeping as
      close as possible to her companion&rsquo;s side, tried to converse, but her
      thoughts were in a tumult like to that about her. She felt a faintness, a
      quivering in her limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I sit down for a moment?&rsquo; she said, looking at Barmby with a
      childlike appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed in a direction away from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have something to say&mdash;it&rsquo;s quieter&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel evinced surprise, but allowed himself to be led towards the black
      mouth of the tunnel, whence at that moment rushed an engine with glaring
      lights upon its breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may not be alone in the train,&rsquo; continued Jessica. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something
      you ought to know I must tell you to-night. You were asking me about Nancy
      Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with panting breath, and looked fixedly at him. The eagerness
      with which he lent ear gave her strength to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You asked me if she was engaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had even forgotten his politeness; he saw in her a mere source of
      information. Jessica moved closer to him on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had you any reason for thinking she was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No particular reason, except something strange in her behaviour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like to know the whole truth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very cold night, and a keen wind swept the platform; but Jessica,
      though indifferently clad, felt no discomfort from this cause. Yet she
      pressed closer to her companion, so that her cheek all but touched his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I should,&rsquo; Barmby answered. &lsquo;Is there any mystery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to tell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you had better not. But why did you begin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why ought I to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you&mdash;.&rsquo; She broke off. A sudden chill made her teeth
      chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;why?&rsquo; asked Samuel, with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you&mdash;are you in love with her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Voice and look embarrassed him. So did the girl&rsquo;s proximity; she was now
      all but leaning on his shoulder. Respectable Mr. Barmby could not be aware
      that Jessica&rsquo;s state of mind rendered her scarcely responsible for what
      she said or did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a very plain question,&rsquo; he began; but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to ask it. There&rsquo;s no need for you to answer. I know you have
      wanted to marry her for a long time. But you never will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not&mdash;if she has promised somebody else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I tell you&mdash;will you be kind to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rsquo; she added hurriedly. &lsquo;I mean&mdash;will you
      understand that I felt it a duty? I oughtn&rsquo;t to tell a secret; but it&rsquo;s a
      secret that oughtn&rsquo;t to be kept. Will you understand that I did it out of&mdash;out
      of friendship for you, and because I thought it right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly. After going so far, you had better tell me and have done
      with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica approached her lips to his ear, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Impossible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was married at Teignmouth, just before she came back from her
      holiday, last year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! Upon my word! And that&rsquo;s why she has been away in Cornwall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Jessica whispered, her body quivering the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a child. It was born last May.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! Upon my word! Now I understand. Who could have imagined!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see what she is. She hides it for the sake of the money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But who is her husband?&rsquo; asked Samuel, staring at the bloodless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man called Tarrant, a relative of Mr. Vawdrey, of Champion Hill. She
      thought he was rich. I don&rsquo;t know whether he is or not, but I believe he
      doesn&rsquo;t mean to come back to her. He&rsquo;s in America now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby questioned, and Jessica answered, until there was nothing left to
      ask or to tell,&mdash;save the one thing which rose suddenly to Jessica&rsquo;s
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t let her know that I have told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel gravely, but coldly, assured her that she need not fear betrayal.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was to be in three volumes. She saw her way pretty clearly to the end
      of the first; she had ideas for the second; the third must take care of
      itself&mdash;until she reached it. Hero and heroine ready to her hand;
      subordinate characters vaguely floating in the background. After an hour
      or two of meditation, she sat down and dashed at Chapter One.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the end of the year it ought to be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in August came her baby&rsquo;s first illness; for nearly a fortnight she
      was away from home, and on her return, though no anxiety remained, she
      found it difficult to resume work. The few chapters completed had a sorry
      look; they did not read well, not at all like writing destined to be read
      in print. After a week&rsquo;s disheartenment she made a new beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of September baby again alarmed her. A trivial ailment as
      before, but she could not leave the child until all was well. Again she
      reviewed her work, and with more repugnance than after the previous
      interruption. But go on with it she must and would. The distasteful
      labour, slow, wearisome, often performed without pretence of hope, went on
      until October. Then she broke down. Mary Woodruff found her crying by the
      fireside, feverish and unnerved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I hear the clock strike every hour, night
      after night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would not confess the cause. In writing her poor novel she had
      lived again through the story enacted at Teignmouth, and her heart failed
      beneath its burden of hopeless longing. Her husband had forsaken her. Even
      if she saw him again, what solace could be found in the mere proximity of
      a man who did not love her, who had never loved her? The child was not
      enough; its fatherless estate enhanced the misery of her own solitude.
      When the leaves fell, and the sky darkened, and the long London winter
      gloomed before her, she sank with a moan of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s strength and tenderness were now invaluable. By sheer force of will
      she overcame the malady in its physical effects, and did wonders in the
      assailing of its moral source. Her appeal now, as formerly, was to the
      nobler pride always struggling for control in Nancy&rsquo;s character. A few
      days of combat with the besieging melancholy that threatened disaster, and
      Nancy could meet her friend&rsquo;s look with a smile. She put away and turned
      the key upon her futile scribbling; no more of that. Novel-writing was not
      her vocation; she must seek again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the afternoon she made ready to go forth on the only business
      which now took her from home. It was nearly a week since she had seen her
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the front door, she came unexpectedly under two pairs of eyes.
      Face to face with her stood Samuel Barmby, his hand raised to signal at
      the knocker, just withdrawn from him. And behind Barmby was a postman,
      holding a letter, which in another moment would have dropped into the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel performed the civil salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&mdash;How do you do, Miss. Lord?&mdash;You are going out, I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am going out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied mechanically, and in speaking took the letter held out to her.
      A glance at it sent all her blood rushing upon the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to see you particularly,&rsquo; said Samuel. &lsquo;Could I call again, this
      afternoon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy gazed at him, but did not hear. He saw the sudden pallor of her
      cheeks, and thought he understood it. As she stood like a statue, he spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very particular business. If you could give me an appointment&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Business?&mdash;Oh, come in, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back to admit him, but in the passage stood looking at her
      letter. Barmby was perplexed and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had rather I called again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Called again? Just as you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, then I will stay,&rsquo; said Samuel bluntly. For he had things in mind
      which disposed him to resent this flagrant discourtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice awakened Nancy. She opened the door of the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you sit down, Mr. Barmby, and excuse me for a few minutes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly. Don&rsquo;t let me inconvenience you, Miss. Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time Nancy would have remarked something very unusual in his
      way of speaking, especially in the utterance of her name. But for the
      letter in her hand she must have noticed with uneasiness a certain
      severity of countenance, which had taken the place of Barmby&rsquo;s wonted
      smile. As it was, she scarcely realised his presence; and, on closing the
      door of the room he had entered, she forthwith forgot that such a man
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her letter! His handwriting at last. And he was in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flew up to her bedroom, and tore open the envelope. He was in London;
      &lsquo;Great College Street, S. W.&rsquo; A short letter, soon read.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAREST NANCY,&mdash;I am ashamed to write, yet write I must. All your
      letters reached me; there was no reason for my silence but the
      unwillingness to keep sending bad news. I have still nothing good to tell
      you, but here I am in London again, and you must know of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I posted my last letter to you from New York, I meant to come back as
      soon as I could get money enough to pay my passage. Since then I have gone
      through a miserable time, idle for the most part, ill for a few weeks, and
      occasionally trying to write something that editors would pay for. But
      after all I had to borrow. It has brought me home (steerage, if you know
      what that means), and now I must earn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to meet, I might be able to say something else. I can&rsquo;t write
      it. Let me hear from you, if you think me worth a letter.&mdash;Yours
      ever, dear girl,
    </p>
    <p>
      L.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a quarter of an hour she stood with this sheet open, as though still
      reading. Her face was void of emotion; she had a vacant look, cheerless,
      but with no more decided significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she remembered that Samuel Barmby was waiting for her downstairs. He
      might have something to say which really concerned her. Better see him at
      once and get rid of him. With slow step she descended to the dining-room.
      The letter, folded and rolled, she carried in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Barmby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. Will you sit down?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course.&rsquo; She spoke abstractedly, and took a seat not far from
      him. &lsquo;I was just going out, but&mdash;there&rsquo;s no hurry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly know how to begin. Perhaps I had better prepare you by saying
      that I have received very strange information.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His air was magisterial; he subdued his voice to a note of profound
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of information?&rsquo; asked Nancy vaguely, her brows knitted in a
      look rather of annoyance than apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very strange indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have said that already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her temper was failing. She felt a nervous impulse to behave rudely, to
      declare the contempt it was always difficult to disguise when talking with
      Barmby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat it, because you seem to have no idea what I am going to speak
      of. I am the last person to find pleasure in such a disagreeable duty as
      is now laid upon me. In that respect, I believe you will do me justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you speak plainly? This roundabout talk is intolerable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel drew himself up, and regarded her with offended dignity. He had
      promised himself no small satisfaction from this interview, had foreseen
      its salient points. His mere aspect would be enough to subdue Nancy, and
      when he began to speak she would tremble before him. Such a moment would
      repay him for the enforced humility of years. Perhaps she would weep; she
      might even implore him to be merciful. How to act in that event he had
      quite made up his mind. But all such anticipations were confused by
      Nancy&rsquo;s singular behaviour. She seemed, in truth, not to understand the
      hints which should have overwhelmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      More magisterial than ever, he began to speak with slow emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord,&mdash;I will still address you by that name,&mdash;though for
      a very long time I have regarded you as a person worthy of all admiration,
      and have sincerely humbled myself before you, I cannot help thinking that
      a certain respect is due to me. Even though I find that you have deceived
      me as to your position, the old feelings are still so strong in me that I
      could not bear to give you needless pain. Instead of announcing to my
      father, and to other people, the strange facts which I have learnt, I come
      here as a friend,&mdash;I speak with all possible forbearance,&mdash;I do
      my utmost to spare you. Am I not justified in expecting at least courteous
      treatment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause of awful impressiveness. The listener, fully conscious at length
      of the situation she had to face, fell into a calmer mood. All was over.
      Suspense and the burden of falsehood had no longer to be endured. Her part
      now, for this hour at all events, was merely to stand by whilst Fate
      unfolded itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please say whatever you have to say, Mr. Barmby,&rsquo; she replied with quiet
      civility. &lsquo;I believe your intention was good. You made me nervous, that
      was all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray forgive me. Perhaps it will be best if I ask you a simple question.
      You will see that the position I hold under your father&rsquo;s will leaves me
      no choice but to ask it. Is it true that you are married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will answer if you tell me how you came to think that I was married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been credibly informed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must forgive me. I can&rsquo;t tell you the name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I can&rsquo;t answer your question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel mused. He was unwilling to break a distinct promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; said Nancy, &lsquo;you have undertaken not to mention the person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it is some one who used to be a friend of mine, you needn&rsquo;t have any
      scruples. She as good as told me what she meant to do. Of course it is
      Miss. Morgan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you have yourself spoken the name&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. She isn&rsquo;t in her senses, and I wonder she has kept the secret
      so long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You admit the truth of what she has told me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I am married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the avowal in a tone very like that in which, to Beatrice French,
      she had affirmed the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your true name is Mrs. Tarrant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crudely masculine in Barmby prompted one more question, but some other
      motive checked him. He let his eyes wander slowly about the room. Even yet
      there was a chance of playing off certain effects which he had rehearsed
      with gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you imagine,&rsquo;&mdash;his voice shook a little,&mdash;&lsquo;how much I
      suffer in hearing you say this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you mean that you still had the hopes expressed in your letter some
      time ago, I can only say, in my defence, that I gave you an honest
      answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. You said you could never marry me. But of course I couldn&rsquo;t
      understand it in this sense. It is a blow. I find it very hard to bear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went to the window, as if ashamed of the emotion he could not
      command. Nancy, too much occupied with her own troubles to ask or care
      whether his distress was genuine, laid Tarrant&rsquo;s letter upon a side-table,
      and began to draw off her gloves. Then she unbuttoned her jacket. These
      out-of-door garments oppressed her. Samuel turned his head and came slowly
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are things that might be said, but I will not say them. Most men in
      my position would yield to the temptation of revenge. But for many years I
      have kept in view a moral ideal, and now I have the satisfaction of
      conquering my lower self. You shall not hear one word of reproach from my
      lips.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for the reply, the expected murmur of gratitude. Nancy said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Tarrant,&rsquo;&mdash;he stood before her,&mdash;&lsquo;what do you suppose must
      be the result of this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There can only be one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean the ruin of your prospects. But do you forget that all the money
      you have received since Mr. Lord&rsquo;s death has been obtained by false
      pretences? Are you not aware that this is a criminal offence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy raised her eyes and looked steadily at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I must bear the punishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute Barmby enjoyed her suffering. Of his foreseen effects, this
      one had come nearest to succeeding. But he was not satisfied; he hoped she
      would beseech his clemency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The punishment might be very serious. I really can&rsquo;t say what view my
      father may take of this deception.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there any use in talking about it? I am penniless&mdash;that&rsquo;s all you
      have to tell me. What else I have to bear, I shall know soon enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing I must ask. Isn&rsquo;t your husband in a position to support you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that. Please to say nothing about my husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby caught at hope. It might be true, as Jessica Morgan believed, that
      Nancy was forsaken. The man Tarrant might be wealthy enough to disregard
      her prospects. In that case an assiduous lover, one who, by the exercise
      of a prudent generosity, had obtained power over the girl, could yet hope
      for reward. Samuel had as little of the villain in his composition as any
      Camberwell householder. He cherished no dark designs. But, after the
      manner of his kind, he was in love with Nancy, and even the long pursuit
      of a lofty ideal does not render a man proof against the elementary forces
      of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will suppose then,&rsquo; he said, with a certain cheerfulness, &lsquo;that you
      have nothing whatever to depend upon but your father&rsquo;s will. What is
      before you? How can you live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my own affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not said offensively, but in a tone of bitter resignation. Barmby
      sat down opposite to her, and leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think for one moment,&rsquo;&mdash;his voice was softly melodious,&mdash;&lsquo;that
      I&mdash;I who have loved you for years&mdash;could let you suffer for want
      of money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not skill to read her countenance. Trouble he discerned, and shame;
      but the half-veiled eyes, the quivering nostril, the hard, cold lips,
      spoke a language beyond Samuel&rsquo;s interpretation. Even had he known of the
      outrages previously inflicted upon her pride, and that this new attack
      came at a moment when her courage was baffled, her heart cruelly wounded,
      he would just as little have comprehended the spirit which now kept her
      mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      He imagined her overcome by his generosity. Another of his great effects
      had come off with tolerable success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put your mind at rest,&rsquo; he pursued mellifluously. &lsquo;You shall suffer no
      hardships. I answer for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still mute, and her head bowed low. Such is the power of nobility
      displayed before an erring soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never done me justice. Confess that you haven&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this remarkable appeal Nancy perforce replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought ill of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had spoken, colour came into her cheeks. Observing it, Samuel was
      strangely moved. Had he impressed her even more profoundly than he hoped
      to do? Jessica Morgan&rsquo;s undisguised subjugation had flattered him into
      credulity respecting his influence over the female mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you didn&rsquo;t think me capable of&mdash;of anything extraordinary?&rsquo; Even
      in her torment, Nancy marvelled at this revelation of fatuity. She did not
      understand the pranks of such a mind as Barmby&rsquo;s when its balance is
      disturbed by exciting circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you offering me?&rsquo; she asked, in a low voice. &lsquo;How could I take
      money from you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that you should. Your secret has been betrayed to me.
      Suppose I refuse to know anything about it, and leave things as they
      were?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy kept her eyes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose I say: Duty bids me injure this woman who has injured <i>me</i>;
      but no, I will not! Suppose I say: I can make her regret bitterly that she
      married that other man; but no, I will not! Suppose, instead of making
      your secret known, I do my utmost to guard it! What would be your opinion
      of this behaviour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think it was kindly meant, but useless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Useless? Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it isn&rsquo;t in your power to guard the secret. Jessica Morgan won&rsquo;t
      leave her work half done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s all, I say again that you can put your mind at rest. I answer
      for Miss. Morgan. With her my will is law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel smiled. A smile ineffable. The smile of a suburban deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you take any trouble about me?&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;I can do nothing
      for you in return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked anxiously at him, for his voice sounded ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can acknowledge that you never did me justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s true that I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she answered languidly; speaking as though the
      concession mattered little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barmby brightened. His hands were upon his knees; he raised his chin, and
      smiled at vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought me unworthy of you. You can confess to me that you were
      mistaken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you as I do now,&rsquo; fell from the expressionless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you for saying that! Well, then, your anxiety is at an end. You are
      not in the hands of a mercenary enemy, but of a man whose principles
      forbid him to do anything ignoble, who has an ideal of life, the result of
      much study and thought. You have never heard me speak about religion, but
      you would be gravely mistaken if you thought I had no religious
      convictions. Some day I shall treat that subject before our Society, and
      it is probable that my views will give rise to a good deal of discussion.
      I have formed a religion for myself; when I write my essay, I think I
      shall call it &ldquo;The Religion of a Man of Business.&rdquo; One of the great evils
      of the day is the vulgar supposition that commerce has nothing to do with
      religious faith. I shall show how utterly wrong that is. It would take too
      long to explain to you my mature views of Christianity. I am not sure that
      I recognise any of the ordinary dogmas; I think I have progressed beyond
      them. However, we shall have many opportunities of talking about these
      things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy uttered a mere &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; She was looking at Tarrant&rsquo;s letter on the
      side-table, and wishing to be alone that she might read it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the meantime,&rsquo; Samuel pursued, &lsquo;whatever difficulty arises, confide it
      to me. Probably you will wish to tell me more before long; you know that I
      am not unworthy to be your adviser. And so let us shake hands, in sign of
      genuine friendship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy gave her fingers, which felt very cold upon Barmby&rsquo;s warm, moist
      palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This conversation has been trying to you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but relief of mind
      will soon follow. If anything occurs to me that may help to soothe you, I
      will write.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the beginning of our interview you didn&rsquo;t think it would end like
      this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something of the boy in Samuel, perhaps the wholesomest part of
      him. Having manifested his admirable qualities, he felt a light-hearted
      pleasure in asking for renewed assurance of the good opinion he had
      earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly cared,&rsquo; said Nancy, as she rose with a sigh of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have got over that. You will be quite cheerful now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In time, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall call again&mdash;let us say on Wednesday evening. By that time I
      shall be able to put you entirely at ease with regard to Miss Morgan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy made no reply. In shaking hands, she regarded the radiant Samuel
      with a dreamy interest; and when he had left her, she still gazed for a
      few moments at the door.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      The habit of confidence prompted Nancy to seek Mary Woodruff, and show her
      the long-expected letter. But for Barmby&rsquo;s visit she would have done so.
      As it was, her mind sullenly resisted the natural impulse. Forlorn misery,
      intensified by successive humiliations, whereof the latest was the
      bitterest, hardened her even against the one, the indubitable friend, to
      whom she had never looked in vain for help and solace. Of course it was
      not necessary to let Mary know with what heart-breaking coldness Tarrant
      had communicated the fact of his return; but she preferred to keep silence
      altogether. Having sunk so low as to accept, with semblance of gratitude,
      pompous favours, dishonouring connivance, at the hands of Samuel Barmby,
      she would now stand alone in her uttermost degradation. Happen what might,
      she would act and suffer in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something she had in mind to do which Mary, if told of it, would regard
      with disapproval. Mary was not a deserted and insulted wife; she could
      reason and counsel with the calmness of one who sympathised, but had
      nothing worse to endure. Even Mary&rsquo;s sympathy was necessarily imperfect,
      since she knew not, and should never know, what had passed in the crucial
      interviews with Beatrice French, with Jessica Morgan, and with Samuel
      Barmby. Bent on indulging her passionate sense of injury, hungering for a
      taste of revenge, however poor, Nancy executed with brief delay a project
      which had come into her head during the hour of torture just elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a sheet of notepaper, and upon it wrote half-a-dozen lines, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As your reward for marrying me is still a long way off, and as you tell
      me that you are in want, I send you as much as I can spare at present.
      Next month you shall hear from me again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the paper she folded a five-pound note, and placed both in an
      envelope, which she addressed to Lionel Tarrant, Esq., at his lodgings in
      Westminster. Having posted this at the first pillar-box she walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her only object was to combat mental anguish by bodily exercise, to
      distract, if possible, the thoughts which hammered upon her brain by
      moving amid the life of the streets. In Camberwell Road she passed the
      place of business inscribed with the names &lsquo;Lord and Barmby&rsquo;; it made her
      think, not of the man who, from being an object of her good-natured
      contempt, was now become a hated enemy, but of her father, and she mourned
      for him with profounder feeling than when her tears flowed over his
      new-made grave. But for headstrong folly, incredible in the retrospect,
      that father would have been her dear and honoured companion, her friend in
      every best sense of the word, her guide and protector. Many and many a
      time had he invited her affection, her trust. For long years it was in her
      power to make him happy, and, in doing so, to enrich her own life, to
      discipline her mind as no study of books, even had it been genuine, ever
      could. Oh, to have the time back again&mdash;the despised privilege&mdash;the
      thwarted embittered love! She was beginning to understand her father, to
      surmise with mature intelligence the causes of his seeming harshness. To
      her own boy, when he was old enough, she would talk of him and praise him.
      Perhaps, even thus late, his spirit of stern truthfulness might bear fruit
      in her life and in her son&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tender memory and pure resolve did not long possess her. They soon
      yielded before the potency of present evil, and for an hour or more she
      walked along the sordid highway, nursing passions which struck their venom
      into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those cold, dry, clouded evenings of autumn, when London
      streets affect the imagination with a peculiar suggestiveness. New-lit
      lamps, sickly yellow under the dying day, stretch in immense vistas,
      unobscured by fog, but exhibit no detail of the track they will presently
      illumine; one by one the shop-fronts grow radiant on deepening gloom, and
      show in silhouette the figures numberless that are hurrying past. By
      accentuating a pause between the life of daytime and that which will begin
      after dark, this grey hour excites to an unwonted perception of the city&rsquo;s
      vastness and of its multifarious labour; melancholy, yet not dismal, the
      brooding twilight seems to betoken Nature&rsquo;s compassion for myriad mortals
      exiled from her beauty and her solace. Noises far and near blend into a
      muffled murmur, sound&rsquo;s equivalent of the impression received by the eye;
      it seems to utter the weariness of unending ineffectual toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had now walked as far as Newington, a district unfamiliar to her,
      and repulsive. By the Elephant and Castle she stood watching the
      tumultuous traffic which whirls and roars at this confluence of six
      highways; she had neither a mind to go on, nor yet to return. The
      conductor of an omnibus close at hand kept bellowing &lsquo;London Bridge!&rsquo; and
      her thoughts wandered to that day of meeting with Luckworth Crewe, when he
      took her up the Monument. She had never felt more than an idle interest in
      Crewe, and whenever she remembered him nowadays, it was only to reflect
      with bitterness that he doubtless knew a part of her secret,&mdash;the
      part that was known to Beatrice French,&mdash;and on that account had
      ceased to urge his suit; yet at this moment she wished that she had
      pledged herself to him in good faith. His behaviour argued the steadfast
      devotion of an honest man, however lacking in refinement. Their long
      engagement would have been brightened with many hopes; in the end she
      might have learned to love him, and prosperity would have opened to her a
      world of satisfactions, for which she could no longer hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew cold. She allowed the movements of a group of people to direct her
      steps, and went eastward along New Kent Road. But when the shops were
      past, and only a dreary prospect of featureless dwellings lay before her,
      she felt her heart sink, and paused in vacillating wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a house near by sounded a piano; a foolish jingle, but it smote her
      with a longing for companionship, for friendly, cheerful talk. And then of
      a sudden she determined that this life of intolerable isolation should
      come to an end. Her efforts to find employment that would bring her among
      people had failed simply because she applied to strangers, who knew
      nothing of her capabilities, and cared nothing for her needs. But a way
      offered itself if she could overcome the poor lingering vestiges of pride
      and shame which hitherto had seemed to render it impossible. In this hour
      her desolate spirit rejected everything but the thought of relief to be
      found in new occupation, fresh society. She had endured to the limit of
      strength. Under the falling night, before the grey vision of a city which,
      by its alien business and pleasure, made her a mere outcast, she all at
      once found hope in a resource which till now had signified despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning the first empty cab, she gave an address known to her only by
      hearsay, that of the South London Fashionable Dress Supply Association,
      and was driven thither in about a quarter of an hour. The shop, with its
      windows cunningly laid out to allure the female eye, spread a brilliant
      frontage between two much duller places of business; at the doorway stood
      a commissionaire, distributing some newly printed advertisements to the
      persons who entered, or who paused in passing. Nancy accepted a paper
      without thinking about it, and went through the swing doors held open for
      her by a stripling in buttons; she approached a young woman at the nearest
      counter, and in a low voice asked whether Miss. French was on the
      premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, madam. I will inquire at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She calls me &ldquo;madam,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Nancy to herself whilst waiting. &lsquo;So do
      shopkeepers generally. I suppose I look old.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young person (she honeyed a Cockney twang) speedily came back to
      report that Miss. French had left about half-an-hour ago, and was not
      likely to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you give me her private address?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having seen Miss. French since the latter&rsquo;s unwelcome call in Grove
      Lane, she only knew that Beatrice had left De Crespigny Park to inhabit a
      flat somewhere or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see her particularly, on business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me a moment, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning, the young person requested Nancy to follow her up the shop,
      and led into a glass-partitioned office, where, at a table covered with
      fashion-plates, sat a middle-aged man, with a bald head of peculiar
      lustre. He rose and bowed; Nancy repeated her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could I despatch a message for you, madam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My business is private.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bald-headed man coughed urbanely, and begged to know her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord&mdash;of Grove Lane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately his countenance changed from deprecating solemnity to a broad
      smile of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Lord! Oh, to be sure; I will give you the address at once. Pray
      pardon my questions; we have to be so very careful. So many people desire
      private interviews with Miss. French. I will jot down the address.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so on the back of an advertisement, and added verbal directions.
      Nancy hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cab conveyed her to Brixton, and set her down before a block of
      recently built flats. She ascended to the second floor, pressed the button
      of a bell, and was speedily confronted by a girl of the natty parlour-maid
      species. This time she began by giving her name, and had only a moment to
      wait before she was admitted to a small drawing-room, furnished with
      semblance of luxury. A glowing fire and the light of an amber-shaded lamp
      showed as much fashionable upholstery and bric-a-brac as could be squeezed
      into the narrow space. Something else was perceptible which might perhaps
      have been dispensed with; to wit, the odour of a very savoury meal, a meal
      in which fried onions had no insignificant part. But before the visitor
      could comment to herself upon this disadvantage attaching to flats,
      Beatrice joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could hardly believe it! So you have really looked me up? Awfully jolly
      of you! I&rsquo;m quite alone; we&rsquo;ll have a bit of dinner together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss. French was in her most expansive mood. She understood the call as
      one of simple friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure that you knew the address. Got it at the shop? They don&rsquo;t
      go telling everybody, I hope&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one there seemed to know my name,&rsquo; said Nancy, whom the warmth and
      light and cheery welcome encouraged in the step she had taken. And she
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mr. Clatworthy&mdash;rum old cove, when you get to know him. Yes,
      yes; no doubt he has heard me speak of you&mdash;in a general way, you
      know. Come into my snooze-corner, and take your things off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The snooze-corner, commonly called a bedroom, lacked one detail of comfort&mdash;pure
      air. The odour of dinner blending with toilet perfumes made an atmosphere
      decidedly oppressive. Beatrice remarked on the smallness of the chamber,
      adding archly, &lsquo;But I sleep single.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your brother doing?&rsquo; she asked, while helping to remove Nancy&rsquo;s
      jacket. &lsquo;I passed him in Oxford Street the other day, and he either didn&rsquo;t
      see me, or didn&rsquo;t want to. Thought he looked rather dissipated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know very little about him,&rsquo; answered the visitor, who spoke and acted
      without reflection, conscious chiefly at this moment of faintness induced
      by fatigue and hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo;s in Paris,&rsquo; pursued Miss. French. &lsquo;Writes as if she was amusing
      herself. I think I shall run over and have a look at her. Seen Ada? She&rsquo;s
      been playing the fool as usual. Found out that Arthur had taken the kid to
      his sister&rsquo;s at Canterbury; went down and made a deuce of a kick-up; they
      had to chuck her out of the house. Of course she cares no more about the
      child than I do; it&rsquo;s only to spite her husband. She&rsquo;s going to law with
      him, she says. She won&rsquo;t leave the house in De Crespigny Park, and she&rsquo;s
      running up bills&mdash;you bet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy tried to laugh. The effort, and its semi-success, indicated
      surrender to her companion&rsquo;s spirit rather than any attention to the
      subject spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the drawing-room, but had not time to begin a
      conversation before the servant summoned them to dinner. A very satisfying
      meal it proved; not badly cooked, as cooking is understood in Brixton, and
      served with more of ceremony than the guest had expected. Fried scallops,
      rump steak smothered in onions, an apple tart, and very sound Stilton
      cheese. Such fare testified to the virile qualities of Beatrice&rsquo;s mind;
      she was above the feminine folly of neglecting honest victuals. Moreover,
      there appeared two wines, sherry and claret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever try this kind of thing?&rsquo; said the hostess finally, reaching
      a box of cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I?&mdash;Of course not,&rsquo; Nancy replied, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s expected of a sensible woman now-a-days. I&rsquo;ve got to like it. Better
      try; no need to make yourself uncomfortable. Just keep the smoke in your
      mouth for half-a-minute, and blow it out prettily. I buy these in the
      Haymarket; special brand for women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you dine like this, by yourself, every day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like this, but not always alone. Some one or other drops in. Luckworth
      Crewe was here yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking, she watched Nancy, who bore the regard with carelessness, and
      replied lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an independent sort of life, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the kind of life that suits me. I&rsquo;m my own mistress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a suggested allusion in the sly tone of the last phrase; but
      Nancy, thinking her own thoughts, did not perceive it. As the servant had
      left them alone, they could now talk freely. Beatrice, by her frequent
      glance of curiosity, seemed to await some explanation of a visit so
      unlooked-for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are things going with you?&rsquo; she asked at length, tapping the ash of
      her cigarette over a plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want something to do,&rsquo; was the blunt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too much alone&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I thought. You don&rsquo;t see him often?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had ceased her pretence of smoking, and leaned back. A flush on her
      face, and something unwonted in the expression of her eyes,&mdash;something
      like a smile, yet touched with apathy,&mdash;told of physical influences
      which assisted her resolve to have done with scruple and delicacy. She
      handled her wine-glass, which was half full, and, before answering, raised
      it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see him often.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I told you to come to me if I could be any use. What&rsquo;s your idea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know of anything I could do? It isn&rsquo;t so much to earn money, as to&mdash;to
      be occupied, and escape from loneliness. But I must have two afternoons in
      the week to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice nodded and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&mdash;not for that,&rsquo; Nancy added hastily. &lsquo;To see my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other appeared to accept this correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. I think I can find you something. We&rsquo;re opening a branch.&rsquo; She
      mentioned the locality. &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be a club-room, like at headquarters,
      and we shall want some one ladylike to sit there and answer questions. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to see any one that knows you, and you&rsquo;d get a good
      deal of fun out of it. Hours from ten to five, but Saturday afternoon off,
      and Wednesday after three, if that would do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that would do very well. Any payment, at first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, we wouldn&rsquo;t be so mean as all that. Say ten shillings a week till
      Christmas, and afterwards we could see&rsquo;&mdash;she laughed&mdash;&lsquo;whether
      you&rsquo;re worth more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing about fashions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can learn all you need to know in an hour. It&rsquo;s the ladylike
      appearance and talk more than anything else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy sipped again from her wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When could I begin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The place &lsquo;ll be ready on Monday week. Next week you might put in a few
      hours with us. Just sit and watch and listen, that&rsquo;s all; to get the hang
      of the thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you for being so ready to help me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it. I haven&rsquo;t done yet. There&rsquo;s a condition. If I fix up
      this job for you, will you tell me something I want to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy turned her eyes apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can guess what it is. I quite believe what you told me some time ago,
      but I shan&rsquo;t feel quite easy until I know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished the sentence with a look. Nancy&rsquo;s eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curiosity, nothing else,&rsquo; added the other. &lsquo;Just to make quite sure it
      isn&rsquo;t anybody I&rsquo;ve thought of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Leaning forward upon the table, Nancy turned her
      wine-glass about and about. She now had a very high colour, and breathed
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it off, then?&rsquo; said Beatrice, in an indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Nancy disclosed the name of her husband&mdash;her lover, as
      Miss. French thought him. Plied with further questions, she told where he
      was living, but gave no account of the circumstances that had estranged
      them. Abundantly satisfied, Beatrice grew almost affectionate, and talked
      merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy wished to ask whether Luckworth Crewe had any knowledge of her
      position. It was long before her lips could utter the words, but at length
      they were spoken. And Beatrice assured her that Crewe, good silly fellow,
      did not even suspect the truth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a man,&rsquo; said Tarrant, &lsquo;who can pay no more than twelve and sixpence a
      week, it&rsquo;s the best accommodation to be found in London. There&rsquo;s an air of
      civilisation about the house. Look; a bath, and a little book-case, and an
      easy-chair such as can be used by a man who respects himself. You feel you
      are among people who tub o&rsquo; mornings and know the meaning of leisure. Then
      the view!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking to his friend Harvey Munden, the journalist. The room in
      which they stood might with advantage have been larger, but as a
      bed-chamber it served well enough, and only the poverty of its occupant,
      who put it to the additional use of sitting-room and study, made the lack
      of space particularly noticeable. The window afforded a prospect pleasant
      enough to eyes such as theirs. Above the lower houses on the opposite side
      of the way appeared tall trees, in the sere garb of later autumn, growing
      by old Westminster School; and beyond them, grey in twilight, rose the
      towers of the Abbey. From this point of view no vicinage of modern
      brickwork spoilt their charm; the time-worn monitors stood alone against a
      sky of ruddy smoke-drift and purple cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old Adam is stronger than ever in me,&rsquo; he pursued. &lsquo;If I were
      condemned for life to the United States, I should go mad, and perish in an
      attempt to swim the Atlantic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why did you stay so long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have stayed with advantage even longer. It&rsquo;s something to have
      studied with tolerable thoroughness the most hateful form of society yet
      developed. I saw it at first as a man does who is living at his ease; at
      last, as a poor devil who is thankful for the institution of free lunches.
      I went first-class, and I came back as a steerage passenger. It has been a
      year well spent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It had made him, in aspect, more than a twelve-month older. His lounging
      attitude, the spirit of his talk, showed that he was unchanged in bodily
      and mental habits; but certain lines new-graven upon his visage, and an
      austerity that had taken the place of youthful self-consciousness,
      signified a more than normal progress in experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Munden slyly, &lsquo;that you have brought back a
      trans-Atlantic accent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accent? The devil! I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Intonation, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant professed a serious annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;ll go and live for a month in Limerick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be cheaper to join a Socialist club in the East End. But just
      tell me how you stand. How long can you hold out in these aristocratic
      lodgings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till Christmas. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say how I&rsquo;ve got the money, so don&rsquo;t ask.
      I reached London with empty pockets. And I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing I have
      learnt, Munden. There&rsquo;s no villainy, no scoundrelism, no baseness
      conceivable, that isn&rsquo;t excused by want of money. I understand the whole
      &ldquo;social question.&rdquo; The man who has never felt the perspiration come out on
      his forehead in asking himself how he is going to keep body and soul
      together, has no right to an opinion on the greatest question of the day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What particular scoundrelism or baseness have you committed?&rsquo; asked the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant averted his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said I could understand such things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One sees that you have been breathed upon by democracy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I loathe the word and the thing even more than I did, which is saying a
      good deal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be it so. You say you are going to work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have come back to work. Even now, it&rsquo;s difficult to realise that I
      must work or starve. I understand how fellows who have unexpectedly lost
      their income go through life sponging on relatives and friends. I
      understand how an educated man goes sinking through all the social grades,
      down to the common lodging-house and the infirmary. And I honestly believe
      there&rsquo;s only one thing that saves me from doing likewise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;not yet, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always thought you a very fine specimen of the man born to do nothing,&rsquo; 
      said Munden, with that smile which permitted him a surprising candour in
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were quite right,&rsquo; returned Tarrant, with a laugh. &lsquo;I am a born
      artist in indolence. It&rsquo;s the pity of pities that circumstances will
      frustrate Nature&rsquo;s purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think you can support yourself by journalism?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must try.&mdash;Run your eye over that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from the table a slip of manuscript, headed, &lsquo;A Reverie in Wall
      Street.&rsquo; Munden read it, sat thoughtful for a moment, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devilish savage. Did you write it after a free lunch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrote it this morning. Shall I try one of the evening papers with it,&mdash;or
      one of the weeklies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Munden suggested a few alterations, and mentioned the journal which he
      thought might possibly find room for such a bit of satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done anything else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a half-finished paper&mdash;&ldquo;The Commercial Prospects of the
      Bahamas.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading a page or two with critically wrinkled forehead, Munden laid
      it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seems pretty solid,&mdash;libellous, too, I should say. You&rsquo;ve more stuff
      in you than I thought. All right: go ahead.&mdash;Come and dine with me
      to-morrow, to meet a man who may be useful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I can&rsquo;t. I dine at Lady Pollard&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know Pollard of Trinity?&mdash;the only son of his mother, and
      she a widow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next day, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t. I dine with some people at Bedford Park.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Munden lifted his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At this rate, you may live pretty well on a dress suit. Any more
      engagements?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None that I know of. But I shall accept all that offer. I&rsquo;m hungry for
      the society of decent English people. I used to neglect my acquaintances;
      I know better now. Go and live for a month in a cheap New York
      boarding-house, and you&rsquo;ll come out with a wholesome taste for English
      refinement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable his friend to read, Tarrant had already lit a lamp. Munden,
      glancing about the room, said carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you still possess the furniture of the old place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the answer, given with annoyance. &lsquo;Vawdrey had it sold for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pictures, books, and all the nick-nacks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything.&mdash;Of course I&rsquo;m sorry for it; but I thought at the time
      that I shouldn&rsquo;t return to England for some years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never said anything of that kind to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the other replied gloomily. And all at once he fell into
      so taciturn a mood, that his companion, after a few more remarks and
      inquiries, rose from his chair to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      From seven to nine Tarrant sat resolutely at his table, and covered a few
      pages with the kind of composition which now came most easily to him,&mdash;a
      somewhat virulent sarcasm. He found pleasure in the work; but after nine
      o&rsquo;clock his thoughts strayed to matters of personal interest, and got
      beyond control. Would the last post of the evening bring him an answer to
      a letter he had despatched this morning? At length he laid down his pen,
      and listened nervously for that knock which, at one time or another, is to
      all men a heart-shaking sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came at the street door, and was quickly followed by a tap at his own.
      Nancy had lost no time in replying. What her letter might contain he found
      it impossible to conjecture. Reproaches? Joyous welcome? Wrath?
      Forgiveness? He knew her so imperfectly, that he could not feel sure even
      as to the probabilities of the case. And his suspense was abundantly
      justified. Her answer came upon him with the force of a shock totally
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the lines again and again; he stared at the bank-note. His first
      sensation was one of painful surprise; thereupon succeeded fiery
      resentment. Reason put in a modest word, hinting that he had deserved no
      better; but he refused to listen. Nothing could excuse so gross an insult.
      He had not thought Nancy capable of this behaviour. Tested, she betrayed
      the vice of birth. Her imputation upon his motive in marrying her was
      sheer vulgar abuse, possible only on vulgar lips. Well and good; now he
      knew her; all the torment of conscience he had suffered was needless. And
      for the moment he experienced a great relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than ten minutes letter and bank-note were enclosed in a new
      envelope, and addressed back again to the sender. With no word of comment;
      she must interpret him as she could, and would. He went out, and threw the
      offensive packet into the nearest receptacle for such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work was over for to-night. After pacing in the obscurity of Dean&rsquo;s Yard
      until his pulse had recovered a normal beat, he issued into the peopled
      ways, and turned towards Westminster Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his neglect of Nancy, he had never ceased to think of her with a
      tenderness which, in his own judgment, signified something more than the
      simple fidelity of a married man. Faithful in the technical sense he had
      not been, but the casual amours of a young man caused him no
      self-reproach; Nancy&rsquo;s image remained without rival in his mind; he had
      continued to acknowledge her claims upon him, and, from time to time, to
      think of her with a lover&rsquo;s longing. As he only wrote when prompted by
      such a mood, his letters, however unsatisfying, were sincere. Various
      influences conflicted with this amiable and honourable sentiment. The
      desire of independence which had speeded him away from England still
      accompanied him on his return; he had never ceased to regret his marriage,
      and it seemed to him that, without this legal bondage, it would have been
      much easier to play a manly part at the time of Nancy&rsquo;s becoming a mother.
      Were she frankly his mistress, he would not be keeping thus far away when
      most she needed the consolation of his presence. The secret marriage
      condemned him to a course of shame, and the more he thought of it, the
      more he marvelled at his deliberate complicity in such a fraud. When
      poverty began to make itself felt, when he was actually hampered in his
      movements by want of money, this form of indignity, more than any galling
      to his pride, intensified the impatience with which he remembered that he
      could no longer roam the world as an adventurer. Any day some trivial
      accident might oppress him with the burden of a wife and child who looked
      to him for their support. Tarrant the married man, unless he were content
      to turn simple rogue and vagabond, must make for himself a place in the
      money-earning world. His indolence had no small part in his revolt against
      the stress of such a consideration. The climate of the Bahamas by no means
      tended to invigorate him, and in the United States he found so much to
      observe,&mdash;even to enjoy,&mdash;that the necessity of effort was kept
      out of sight as long as, by one expedient and another, he succeeded in
      procuring means to live upon without working.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the homeward voyage&mdash;a trial such as he had never known, amid
      squalid discomforts which enraged even more than they disgusted him&mdash;his
      heart softened in anticipation of a meeting with Nancy, and of the sight
      of his child. Apart from his fellow-travellers,&mdash;in whom he could
      perceive nothing but coarseness and vileness,&mdash;he spent the hours in
      longing for England and for the home he would make there, in castigating
      the flagrant faults of his character, moderating his ambitions, and
      endeavouring to find a way out of the numerous grave difficulties with
      which his future was beset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Landed, he rather forgot than discarded these wholesome meditations. What
      he had first to do was so very unpleasant, and taxed so rudely his
      self-respect, that he insensibly fell back again into the rebellious
      temper. Choice there was none; reaching London with a few shillings in his
      pocket, of necessity he repaired forthwith to Mr Vawdrey&rsquo;s office in the
      City, and made known the straits into which he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Vawdrey, with his usual good-humour, &lsquo;how
      much have you had of me since you started for the Bahamas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is hardly a fair question,&rsquo; Tarrant replied, endeavouring not to
      hang his head like an everyday beggar. &lsquo;I went out on a commission&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True. But after you ceased to be a commissioner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have lent me seventy pounds. Living in the States is expensive. What
      I got for my furniture has gone as well, yet I certainly haven&rsquo;t been
      extravagant; and for the last month or two I lived like a tramp. Will you
      make my debt to you a round hundred? It shall be repaid, though I may be a
      year or two about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The loan was granted, but together with a great deal of unpalatable
      counsel. Having found his lodging, Tarrant at once invested ten pounds in
      providing himself with a dress suit, and improving his ordinary attire,&mdash;he
      had sold every garment he could spare in New York. For the dress suit he
      had an immediate use; on the very platform of Euston Station, at his
      arrival, a chance meeting with one of his old college friends resulted in
      an invitation to dine, and, even had not policy urged him to make the most
      of such acquaintances, he was in no mood for rejecting a summons back into
      the world of civilisation. Postponing the purposed letter to Nancy (which,
      had he written it sooner, would have been very unlike the letter he
      subsequently sent), he equipped himself once more as a gentleman, and
      spent several very enjoyable hours in looking up the members of his former
      circle&mdash;Hodiernals and others. Only to Harvey Munden did he confide
      something of the anxieties which lay beneath his assumed lightheartedness.
      Munden was almost the only man he knew for whom he had a genuine respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renewal of intercourse with people of good social standing made him more
      than ever fretful in the thought that he had clogged himself with
      marriage. Whatever Nancy&rsquo;s reply to his announcement that he was home
      again, he would have read it with discontent. To have the fact forced upon
      him (a fact he seriously believed it) that his wife could not be depended
      upon even for elementary generosity of thought, was at this moment
      especially disastrous; it weighed the balance against his feelings of
      justice and humanity, hitherto, no matter how he acted, always
      preponderant over the baser issues of character and circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood leaning upon the parapet of Westminster Bridge, his eyes scanning
      the dark facade of the Houses of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would the strong, unscrupulous, really ambitious man act in such a
      case? What was to prevent him from ignoring the fact that he was married,
      and directing his course precisely as he would have done if poverty had
      come upon him before his act of supreme foolishness? Journalism must have
      been his refuge then, as now; but Society would have held out to him the
      hope of every adventurer&mdash;a marriage with some woman whose wealth and
      connections would clear an upward path in whatever line he chose to
      follow. Why not abandon to Nancy the inheritance it would degrade him to
      share, and so purchase back his freedom? The bargain might be made; a
      strong man would carry it through, and ultimately triumph by daring all
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having wrought himself to this point of insensate revolt, he quitted his
      musing-station on the bridge, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy did not write again. There passed four or five days, and Tarrant,
      working hard as well as enjoying the pleasures of Society, made up his
      mind not to see her. He would leave events to take their course. A
      heaviness of heart often troubled him, but he resisted it, and told
      himself that he was becoming stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long day of writing, he addressed a packet to a certain
      periodical, and went out to post it. No sooner had he left the house than
      a woman, who had been about to pass him on the pavement, abruptly turned
      round and hurriedly walked away. But for this action, he would not have
      noticed her; as it was, he recognised the figure, and an impulse which
      allowed of no reflection brought him in a moment to her side. In the
      ill-lighted street a face could with difficulty be observed, but Nancy&rsquo;s
      features were unmistakable to the eye that now fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, and let me speak to you,&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked only the more quickly, and he was obliged to take her by the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as if to an insolent stranger, and shook off his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have nothing to say to me, why are you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here? I suppose the streets are free to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing would bring you to Great College Street if you didn&rsquo;t know that I
      was living here. Now that we have met, we must talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing at all to say to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then <i>I</i> will talk.&mdash;Come this way; there&rsquo;s a quiet place
      where no one will notice us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy kept her eyes resolutely averted from him; he, the while, searched
      her face with eagerness, as well as the faint rays of the nearest lamp
      allowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have anything to say, you must say it here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use, then. Go your way, and I&rsquo;ll go mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and walked slowly in the direction of Dean&rsquo;s Yard. There was
      the sound of a step behind him, and when he had come into the dark, quiet
      square, Nancy was there too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better to be reasonable,&rsquo; said Tarrant, approaching her again. &lsquo;I want to
      ask you why you answered a well-meant letter with vulgar insult?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The insult came from you,&rsquo; she answered, in a shaking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did I say that gave you offence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you ask such a question? To write in that way after never
      answering my letter for months, leaving me without a word at such a time,
      making me think either that you were dead or that you would never let me
      hear of you again&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you it was a mere note, just to let you know I was back. I said
      you should hear more when we met.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, we have met. What have you to say for yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First of all, this. That you are mistaken in supposing I should ever
      consent to share your money. The thought was natural to you, no doubt; but
      I see things from a different point of view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His cold anger completely disguised the emotion stirred in him by Nancy&rsquo;s
      presence. Had he not spoken thus, he must have given way to joy and
      tenderness. For Nancy seemed more beautiful than the memory he had
      retained of her, and even at such a juncture she was far from exhibiting
      the gross characteristics attributed to her by his rebellious imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; were her next words, &lsquo;why you wrote to me again
      at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are many things in me that you don&rsquo;t understand, and can&rsquo;t
      understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think so. That&rsquo;s why I see no use in our talking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant was ashamed of what he had said&mdash;a meaningless retort, which
      covered his inability to speak as his heart prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events I wanted to see you, and it&rsquo;s fortunate you passed just as
      I was coming out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy would not accept the conciliatory phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the least intention of seeing you,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;It was a
      curiosity to know where you lived, nothing else. I shall never forgive you
      for the way in which you have behaved to me, so you needn&rsquo;t try to explain
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here and now, I should certainly not try. The only thing I will say about
      myself is, that I very much regret not having made known that you were
      married to me when plain honesty required it. Now, I look upon it as
      something over and done with, as far as I am concerned. I shall never
      benefit by the deception&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know that <i>I</i> shall benefit by it? How can you tell what
      has been happening since you last heard from me in America?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have taken it for granted that things are the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t even take measures to have news of me from any one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What need? I should always have received any letter you sent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought it likely that I should appeal to you if I were in
      difficulties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood silent, glad of the obscurity which made it needless for him to
      command his features. At length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the simple fact? Has your secret been discovered, or not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does it concern you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only in this way: that if you are to be dependent upon any one, it must
      be upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy gave a scornful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very generous, considering your position. But happily you can&rsquo;t
      force me to accept your generosity, any more than I can compel you to take
      a share of my money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without the jibe at my poverty,&rsquo; Tarrant said, &lsquo;that is a sufficient
      answer. As we can&rsquo;t even pretend to be friendly with each other, I am very
      glad there need be no talk of our future relations. You are provided for,
      and no doubt will take care not to lose the provision. If ever you prefer
      to forget that we are legally bound, I shall be no obstacle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have thought of that,&rsquo; replied Nancy, after a pause, her voice
      expressing satisfaction. &lsquo;Perhaps we should do better to make the
      understanding at once. You are quite free; I should never acknowledge you
      as my husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seriously mean it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I seem to be joking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. I won&rsquo;t say that I should never acknowledge you as my wife; so
      far from that, I hold myself responsible whenever you choose to make any
      kind of claim upon me. But I shall not dream of interfering with your
      liberty. If ever you wish to write to me, you may safely address to the
      house at Champion Hill.&mdash;And remember always,&rsquo; he added sternly,
      &lsquo;that it was not I who made such a parting necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy returned his look through the gloom, and said in like tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do my best never to think of it at all. Fortunately, my time and
      my thoughts are occupied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; Tarrant could not help asking, as she turned away; for her tone
      implied some special significance in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no right to ask anything whatever about me,&rsquo; came from Nancy,
      who was already moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed her to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is to be as I wished,&rsquo; he said to himself, with mock courage. &lsquo;So
      much the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went home to a night of misery.

      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not long after the disappearance of Fanny French, Mrs. Damerel called one
      day upon Luckworth Crewe at his office in Farringdon Street. Crewe seldom
      had business with ladies, and few things could have surprised him more
      than a visit from this lady in particular, whom he knew so well by name,
      and regarded with such special interest. She introduced herself as a
      person wishing to find a good investment for a small capital; but the
      half-hour&rsquo;s conversation which followed became in the end almost a
      confidential chat. Mrs. Damerel spoke of her nephew Horace Lord, with
      whom, she understood, Mr. Crewe was on terms of intimacy; she professed a
      grave solicitude on his account, related frankly the unhappy circumstances
      which had estranged the young man from her, and ultimately asked whether
      Crewe could not make it worth his own while to save Horace from the shoals
      of idleness, and pilot him into some safe commercial haven. This meeting
      was the first of many between the fashionable lady and the keen man of
      affairs. Without a suspicion of how it had come about, Horace Lord
      presently found himself an informal partner in Crewe&rsquo;s business; he
      invested only a nominal sum, which might be looked upon as a premium of
      apprenticeship; but there was an understanding that at the close of the
      term of tutelage imposed by his father&rsquo;s will, he should have the offer of
      a genuine partnership on very inviting terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace was not sorry to enter again upon regular occupation. He had
      considerably damaged his health in the effort to live up to his ideal of
      thwarted passion, and could no longer entertain a hope that Fanny&rsquo;s
      escapade was consistent with innocence. Having learnt how money slips
      through the fingers of a gentleman with fastidious tastes, he welcomed a
      prospect of increased resources, and applied himself with some energy to
      learning his new business. But with Mrs. Damerel he utterly refused to be
      reconciled, and of his sister he saw very little. Nancy, however, approved
      the step he had taken, and said she would be content to know that all was
      well with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a Sunday morning, when the church bells had ceased to clang,
      Luckworth Crewe, not altogether at his ease in garb of flagrant
      respectability, sat by the fireside of a pleasant little room conversing
      with Mrs. Damerel. Their subject, as usual at the beginning of talk, was
      Horace Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t speak of you at all,&rsquo; said Crewe, in a voice singularly subdued,
      sympathetic, respectful. &lsquo;I have done all I could, short of telling him
      that I know you. He&rsquo;s very touchy still on that old affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How would he like it,&rsquo; asked the lady, &lsquo;if you told him that we are
      acquaintances?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible to say. Perhaps it would make no difference one way or
      another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel was strikingly, yet becomingly, arrayed. The past year had
      dealt no less gently with her than its predecessors; if anything, her
      complexion had gained in brilliancy, perhaps a consequence of the hygienic
      precautions due to her fear of becoming stout. A stranger, even a
      specialist in the matter, might have doubted whether the fourth decade lay
      more than a month or two behind her. So far from seeking to impress her
      visitor with a pose of social superiority, she behaved to him as though
      his presence honoured as much as it delighted her; look, tone, bearing,
      each was a flattery which no obtuseness could fail to apprehend, and
      Crewe&rsquo;s countenance proved him anything but inappreciative. Hitherto she
      had spoken and listened with her head drooping in gentle melancholy; now,
      with a sudden change intended to signify the native buoyancy of her
      disposition, she uttered a rippling laugh, which showed her excellent
      teeth, and said prettily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor boy! I must suffer the penalty of having tried to save him from one
      of my own sex.&mdash;Not,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that I foresaw how that poor silly
      girl would justify my worst fears of her. Perhaps,&rsquo; her head drooping
      again, &lsquo;I ought to reproach myself with what happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that at all,&rsquo; replied Crewe, whose eyes lost nothing of the
      exhibition addressed to them. &lsquo;Even if you had been the cause of it, which
      of course you weren&rsquo;t, I should have said you had done the right thing.
      Every one knew what Fanny French must come to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it sad? A pretty girl&mdash;but so ill brought up, I fear. Can you
      give me any news of her sister, the one who came here and frightened me
      so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s going on as usual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe checked himself, and showed hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She almost threatened me,&rsquo; Mrs. Damerel pursued, with timid sweetness.
      &lsquo;Do you think she is the kind of person to plot any harm against one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She had better not try it on,&rsquo; said Crewe, in his natural voice. Then, as
      if recollecting himself, he pursued more softly: &lsquo;But I was going to speak
      of her. You haven&rsquo;t heard that Miss. Lord has taken a position in the new
      branch of that Dress Supply Association?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel kept an astonished silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There can&rsquo;t be any doubt of it; I have been told on the best authority.
      She is in what they call the &ldquo;club-room,&rdquo; a superintendent. It&rsquo;s a queer
      thing; what can have led her to it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must make inquiries,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel, with an air of concern. &lsquo;How
      sad it is, Mr. Crewe, that these young relatives of mine,&mdash;almost the
      only relatives I have,&mdash;should refuse me their confidence and their
      affection. Pray, does Horace know of what his sister is doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t speak to him about it until I had seen you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How very kind! How grateful I am to you for your constant
      thoughtfulness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Crewe should have practised such reticence, why it signified kindness
      and thoughtfulness to Mrs. Damerel, neither he nor she could easily have
      explained. But their eyes met, with diffident admiration on the one side,
      and touching amiability on the other. Then they discussed Nancy&rsquo;s
      inexplicable behaviour from every point of view; or rather, Mrs. Damerel
      discussed it, and her companion made a pretence of doing so. Crewe&rsquo;s
      manner had become patently artificial; he either expressed himself in
      trivial phrases, which merely avoided silence, or betrayed an
      embarrassment, an abstraction, which caused the lady to observe him with
      all the acuteness at her command.
    </p>
    <p>
      You haven&rsquo;t seen her lately?&rsquo; she asked, when Crewe had been staring at
      the window for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seen her?&mdash;No; not for a long time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you told me you haven&rsquo;t called there since Mr. Lord&rsquo;s death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never was there at all,&rsquo; he answered abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I remember your saying so. Of course there is no reason why she
      shouldn&rsquo;t go into business, if time is heavy on her hands, as I dare say
      it may be. So many ladies prefer to have an occupation of that kind
      now-a-days. It&rsquo;s a sign of progress; we are getting more sensible; Society
      used to have such silly prejudices. Even within my recollection&mdash;how
      quickly things change!&mdash;no lady would have dreamt of permitting her
      daughter to take an engagement in a shop or any such place. Now we have
      women of title starting as milliners and modistes, and soon it will be
      quite a common thing to see one&rsquo;s friends behind the counter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a gay little laugh, in which Crewe joined unmelodiously,&mdash;for
      he durst not be merry in the note natural to him,&mdash;then raised her
      eyes in playful appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If ever I should fall into misfortune, Mr. Crewe, would you put me in the
      way of earning my living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re above all that kind of thing. It&rsquo;s for the rough and
      ready sort of women, and I can&rsquo;t say I have much opinion of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a very nice little compliment; but at the same time, it&rsquo;s rather
      severe on the women who are practical.&mdash;Tell me frankly: Is my&mdash;my
      niece one of the people you haven&rsquo;t much opinion of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe shuffled his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of Miss. Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is really your opinion of her?&rsquo; Mrs. Damerel urged softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe looked up and down, smiled in a vacant way, and appeared very
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I guess the truth?&rsquo; said his playful companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I wanted to marry her, and did my best to get her to
      promise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought so!&rsquo; She paused on the note of arch satisfaction, and mused.
      &lsquo;How nice of you to confess!&mdash;And that&rsquo;s all past and forgotten, is
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never man more unlike himself than the bold advertising-agent in this
      colloquy. He was subdued and shy; his usual racy and virile talk had given
      place to an insipid mildness. He seemed bent on showing that the graces of
      polite society were not so strange to him as one might suppose. But under
      Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s interrogation a restiveness began to appear in him, and at
      length he answered in his natural blunt voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all over&mdash;and for a good reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s curiosity was still more provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she exclaimed laughingly, &lsquo;I am <i>not</i> going to ask the reason.
      That would be presuming too far on friendship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe fixed his eyes on a corner of the room, and seemed to look there for
      a solution of some difficulty. When the silence had lasted more than a
      minute, he began to speak slowly and awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to&mdash;in fact, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that you ought to
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The good reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re the only one that could stand in the place of a mother to
      her. And I don&rsquo;t think she ought to be living alone, like she is, with no
      one to advise and help her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have felt that very strongly,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel. &lsquo;The old servant who
      is with her can&rsquo;t be at all a suitable companion&mdash;that is, to be
      treated on equal terms. A very strange arrangement, indeed. But you don&rsquo;t
      mean that you thought less well of her because she is living in that way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not. It&rsquo;s something a good deal more serious than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel became suddenly grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I certainly ought to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought. I think it very likely she would have been glad enough to make
      a friend of you, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for this&mdash;this affair, which stood
      in the way. There can&rsquo;t be any harm in telling you, as you couldn&rsquo;t wish
      anything but her good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That surely you may take for granted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, I have an idea that she&rsquo;s trying to earn money because some
      one is getting all he can out of her&mdash;leaving her very little for
      herself; and if so, it&rsquo;s time you interfered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener was so startled that she changed colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that some man has her in his power?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, it comes to that. But for her father&rsquo;s will, she
      would have been married long ago, and&mdash;she ought to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having blurted out these words, Crewe felt much more at ease. As Mrs.
      Damerel&rsquo;s eyes fell, the sense of sexual predominance awoke in him, and he
      was no longer so prostrate before the lady&rsquo;s natural and artificial
      graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know this?&rsquo; she asked, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From some one who had it from Miss. Lord herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you quite sure that it isn&rsquo;t a malicious falsehood?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As sure as I am that I sit here. I know the man&rsquo;s name, and where he
      lives, and all about him. And I know where the child is at nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child?&mdash;Oh&mdash;surely&mdash;never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A genuine agitation possessed her; she had a frightened, pain-stricken
      look, and moved as if she must act without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly six months old,&rsquo; Crewe continued. &lsquo;Of course that&rsquo;s why she
      was away so long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why haven&rsquo;t you told me this before? It was your duty to tell me&mdash;your
      plain duty. How long have you known?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard of it first of all about three months ago, but it was only the
      other day that I was told the man&rsquo;s name, and other things about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it known to many people? Is the poor girl talked about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; Crewe replied, with confidence. &lsquo;The person who told me is the
      only one who has found it out; you may depend upon that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be a woman,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a woman. Some one <i>I</i> know very well. She told me just
      because she thought I was still hoping to marry Miss. Lord, and&mdash;well,
      the truth is, though we&rsquo;re good friends, she has a little spite against
      me, and I suppose it amused her to tell me something disagreeable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel, &lsquo;that the secret has been betrayed
      to a dozen people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go bail it hasn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; returned Crewe, falling into his vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can hardly believe it at all. I should never have dreamt that such a
      thing was possible. What is the man&rsquo;s name? what is his position?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tarrant is his name, and he&rsquo;s related somehow to a Mr. Vawdrey, well
      known in the City, who has a big house over at Champion Hill. I have no
      notion how they came together, or how long it was going on. But this Mr.
      Tarrant has been in America for a year, I understand; has only just come
      back; and now he&rsquo;s living In poorish lodgings,&mdash;Great College Street,
      Westminster. I&rsquo;ve made a few inquiries about him, but I can&rsquo;t get at very
      much. A man who knows Vawdrey tells me that Tarrant has no means, and that
      he&rsquo;s a loafing, affected sort of chap. If that&rsquo;s true,&mdash;and it seems
      likely from the way he&rsquo;s living,&mdash;of course he will be ready enough
      to marry Miss. Lord when the proper time has come; I&rsquo;m only afraid that&rsquo;s
      all he had in view from the first. And I can&rsquo;t help suspecting, as I said,
      that she&rsquo;s supporting him now. If not, why should she go and work in a
      shop? At all events, a decent man wouldn&rsquo;t allow her to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A decent man,&rsquo; said the listener, &lsquo;would never have allowed her to fall
      into disgrace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; Crewe assented with energy. &lsquo;And as for my keeping quiet
      about it, Mrs. Damerel, you&rsquo;ve only to think what an awkward affair it was
      to mention. I&rsquo;m quite sure you&rsquo;ll have a little feeling against me,
      because I knew of it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you not to think that!&rsquo; She returned to her manner of suave
      friendliness. &lsquo;I shall owe you gratitude for telling me, and nothing but
      gratitude. You have behaved with very great delicacy; I cannot say how
      highly I appreciate your feeling on the poor girl&rsquo;s behalf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I can be of any use, I am always at your service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, dear Mr. Crewe, thank you! In you I have found a real friend,&mdash;and
      how rarely they are met with! Of course I shall make inquiries at once. My
      niece must be protected. A helpless girl in that dreadful position may
      commit unheard-of follies. I fear you are right. He is making her his
      victim. With such a secret, she is absolutely at his mercy. And it
      explains why she has shunned me. Oh, do you think her brother knows it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure he doesn&rsquo;t; hasn&rsquo;t the least suspicion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not. But it&rsquo;s wonderful how she has escaped. Your informant&mdash;how
      did she find it out? You say she had the story from the girl&rsquo;s own lips.
      But why? She must have shown that she knew something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe imparted such details as had come to his knowledge; they were
      meagre, and left many obscurities, but Mrs. Damerel rewarded him with
      effusive gratitude, and strengthened the spell which she had cast upon
      this knight of Farringdon Street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every day Tarrant said to himself: &lsquo;I am a free man; I was only married in
      a dream.&rsquo; Every night he thought of Nancy, and suffered heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, too, of Nancy&rsquo;s child, his own son. That Nancy was a tender
      mother, he knew from the letter she had written him after the baby&rsquo;s
      birth,&mdash;a letter he would have liked to read again, but forbore. Must
      not the separation from her child be hard? If he saw the poor little
      mortal, how would the sight affect him? At moments he felt a longing
      perhaps definable as the instinct of paternity; but he was not the man to
      grow sentimental over babies, his own or other people&rsquo;s. Irony and sarcasm&mdash;very
      agreeable to a certain class of newspaper readers&mdash;were just now his
      stock-in-trade, and he could not afford to indulge any softer mode of
      meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His acquaintances agreed that the year of absence had not improved him. He
      was alarmingly clever; he talked well; but his amiability, the poetry of
      his mind, seemed to have been lost in America. He could no longer admire
      or praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own part, he did not clearly perceive this change. It struck him
      only that the old friends were less interesting than he had thought them;
      and he looked for reception in circles better able to appreciate his
      epigrams and paradoxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks of such life broke him so completely to harness, that he
      forgot the seasonable miseries which had been wont to drive him from
      London at the approach of November. When the first fog blackened against
      his windows, he merely lit the lamp and wrote on, indifferent. Two years
      ago he had declared that a London November would fatally blight his soul;
      that he must flee to a land of sunshine, or perish. There was little time,
      now, to think about his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Monday morning arrived a letter which surprised and disturbed him. It
      ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Eustace Damerel presents her compliments to Mr. Tarrant, and would
      take it as a great favour if he could call upon her, either to-morrow or
      Tuesday, at any hour between three and seven. She particularly desires to
      see Mr. Tarrant on a private matter of mutual interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this could have but one meaning. Mrs. Eustace Damerel was, of course,
      Nancy&rsquo;s relative; from Nancy herself, or in some other way, she must have
      learnt the fact of his marriage. Probably from Nancy, since she knew where
      he lived. He was summoned to a judicial interview. Happily, attendance was
      not compulsory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second thoughts advised him that he had better accept the invitation. He
      must know what measures were in progress against him. If Nancy had already
      broken her word, she might be disposed to revenge herself in every way
      that would occur to an angry woman of small refinement; she might make
      life in London impossible for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and penned a reply, saying that he would call upon Mrs.
      Damerel at five to-morrow. But he did not post this. After all, a day&rsquo;s
      delay would only irritate him; better to go this afternoon, in which case
      it was not worth while sending an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him very probable that Nancy would be with her aunt, to
      confront him. If so,&mdash;if indeed she were going to act like any coarse
      woman, with no regard but for her own passions and Interests,&mdash;he
      would at least have the consolation of expelling from his mind, at once
      and for ever, her haunting image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel, who during the past twelve months had changed her abode
      half-a-dozen times, now occupied private lodgings in Tyburnia. On his
      admittance, Tarrant sat alone for nearly five minutes in a pretentiously
      furnished room&mdash;just the room in which he had expected to find
      Nancy&rsquo;s relative; the delay and the surroundings exasperated his nervous
      mood, so that, when the lady entered, he behaved with slighter courtesy
      than became his breeding. Nothing in her appearance surprised or
      interested him. There was a distant facial resemblance to Nancy, natural
      in her mother&rsquo;s sister; there was expensive, though not particularly
      tasteful dress, and a gait, a manner, distinguishable readily enough from
      what they aimed at displaying&mdash;the grace of a woman born to social
      privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a humiliating conversation; Tarrant braced himself to go
      through with it. He stood stiffly while his hostess regarded him with
      shrewd eyes. She had merely bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you sit down, Mr. Tarrant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a chair without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you know me by name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of a Mrs. Damerel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some time ago, I suppose? And in that you have the advantage of me. I
      heard your name yesterday for the first time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sharp rejoinder of a woman of the world. Tarrant began to
      perceive that he had to do with intelligence, and would not be allowed to
      perform his share of the talking <i>de haut en bas.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what can I be of service to you?&rsquo; he asked with constrained civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can tell me, please, what sort of connection there is between you and
      my niece, Miss. Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel was obviously annoyed by his demeanour, and made little
      effort to disguise her feeling. She gave him the look of one who does not
      mean to be trifled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; answered the young man with a smile, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      authority you have to make such inquiries. You are not, I believe, Miss.
      Lord&rsquo;s guardian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but I am her only relative who can act on her behalf where knowledge
      of the world is required. As a gentleman, you will bear this in mind. It&rsquo;s
      quite true that I can&rsquo;t oblige you to tell me anything; but when I say
      that I haven&rsquo;t spoken even to my niece of what I have heard, and haven&rsquo;t
      communicated with the gentlemen who <i>are</i> her guardians, I think you
      will see that I am not acting in a way you ought to resent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean, Mrs. Damerel, that what passes between us is in confidence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only mean, Mr. Tarrant, that I am giving you an opportunity of
      explaining yourself&mdash;so that I can keep the matter private if your
      explanation is satisfactory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a charge of some kind to bring against me,&rsquo; said Tarrant
      composedly. &lsquo;I must first of all hear what it is. The prisoner at the bar
      can&rsquo;t be prosecuting counsel at the same time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you acknowledge that you are on intimate terms with Miss. Lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have known her for a year or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant began to exercise caution. Nancy had no hand in this matter; some
      one had told tales about her, that was all. He must learn, without
      committing himself, exactly how much had been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you engaged to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Engaged to marry her? No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw in Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s clear eye that she convicted him of ambiguities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not even made her a promise of marriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much simpler, if you would advance a clear charge. I will answer it
      honestly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel seemed to weigh the value of this undertaking. Tarrant met
      her gaze with steady indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may only be a piece of scandal,&mdash;a mistake, or a malicious
      invention. I have been told that&mdash;that you are in everything but law
      my niece&rsquo;s husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They regarded each other during a moment&rsquo;s silence. Tarrant&rsquo;s look
      indicated rapid and anxious thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems,&rsquo; he said at length, &lsquo;that you have no great faith in the person
      who told you this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the easiest matter in the world to find out whether the story is
      true or not. Inquiries at Falmouth would be quite sufficient, I dare say.
      I give you the opportunity of keeping it quiet, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t care to let me know who told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel, after reflection.
      &lsquo;Do you know Mr. Luckworth Crewe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard the name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed? He is well acquainted with Miss. Lord. Some one he wouldn&rsquo;t
      mention gave him all the particulars, having learnt them from Miss Lord
      herself, and he thought it his duty to inform me of my niece&rsquo;s very
      painful position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is this man?&rsquo; Tarrant asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am rather surprised you have never heard of him. He&rsquo;s a man of
      business. My nephew, Mr. Horace Lord, is shortly to be in partnership with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crewe? No, the name is quite strange to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant&rsquo;s countenance darkened; he paused for an instant, then added
      impatiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say he had &ldquo;all the particulars.&rdquo; What were they, these particulars?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will one be enough? A child was born at Falmouth, and is now at a place
      just outside London, in the care of some stranger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The source of this information might, or might not, be Nancy herself. In
      either case, there was no further hope of secrecy. Tarrant abandoned his
      reserve, and spoke quietly, civilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So far, you have heard the truth. What have you to ask of me, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been abroad for a long time, I think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For about a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does that mean that you wished to see no more of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I deserted her, in plain words? It meant nothing of the kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware, then, that she has taken a place in a house of business,
      just as if she thought it necessary to earn her own living?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant displayed astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am aware of no such thing. How long has that been going on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t see her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen her, but she told me nothing of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something very strange in this, Mr. Tarrant. You seem to me to be
      speaking the truth. No, please don&rsquo;t take offence. Before I saw you, you
      were a total stranger to me, and after what I had heard, I couldn&rsquo;t think
      very well of you. I may as well confess that you seem a different kind of
      man from what I expected. I don&rsquo;t wish to offend you, far from it. If we
      can talk over this distressing affair in a friendly way, so much the
      better. I have nothing whatever in view but to protect my niece&mdash;to
      do the best that can be done for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I have taken for granted,&rsquo; Tarrant replied. &lsquo;I understand that you
      expected to meet a scoundrel of a very recognisable type. Well, I am not
      exactly that. But what particular act of rascality have you in mind?
      Something worse than mere seduction, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you answer a disagreeable question? Are you well-to-do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything but that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed? And you can form no idea why Nancy has gone to work in a shop?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; he said deliberately. &lsquo;You suspect that I have been taking money
      from her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>did</i> suspect it; now it seems to me more unlikely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many thanks,&rsquo; he answered, with cold irony. &lsquo;So the situation was this:
      Miss. Lord had been led astray by a rascally fellow, who not only left her
      to get on as best she could, but lived on her income, so that she had at
      length to earn money for her own needs. There&rsquo;s something very clear and
      rounded, very dramatic, about that. What I should like to know is, whether
      Miss. Lord tells the story in this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say that she does. I think it was Mr. Crewe who explained things
      like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am obliged to Mr. Crewe. But he may, after all, only repeat what he has
      heard. It&rsquo;s a pity we don&rsquo;t know Miss. Lord&rsquo;s actual confidante.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you have <i>not</i> received assistance from her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant stared for a moment, then laughed unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no recollection of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another disagreeable question. Did you really go away and leave her to
      get on as best she could?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked darkly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if I did?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it rather unaccountable behaviour&mdash;in a gentleman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. There is something unexplained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there <i>is</i> something unexplained.&mdash;Mrs. Damerel, I should
      have thought you would naturally speak first to your niece. Why did you
      send for me before doing so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To find out what sort of man you were, so that I should be able to form
      my own opinion of what Nancy chose to tell me. Perhaps she may refuse to
      tell me anything at all&mdash;we are not like ordinary relatives, I am
      sorry to say. But I dare say you know better than I do how she thinks of
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard her speak of you only once or twice. At all events, now that
      you are prepared, you will go and see her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must. It would be wrong to stand by and do nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will see her guardians?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That must depend. I certainly shall if she seems to be suffering
      hardships. I must know why she goes out to work, as if she were pinched
      for money. There is her child to support, of course, but that wouldn&rsquo;t
      make any difference to her; she is well provided for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s no choice but to fall back upon the villain theory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go yet, Mr. Tarrant,&rsquo; said his hostess firmly. &lsquo;I have said
      that I can&rsquo;t believe such things of you. If you would only explain&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I can&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s as much a mystery to me as to you&mdash;her
      wishing to earn money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to say&mdash;if you would only explain your intentions as to
      the future&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My intentions will depend entirely on what I hear from your niece. I
      shall see her as soon as possible. Perhaps you can tell me at what hour
      she returns from business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. I wish you would talk a little longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes flashed angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Damerel, I have said all that I am willing to say. What you have
      heard is partly true; you probably won&rsquo;t have to wait very long for the
      rest of the story, but I have no time and no inclination to tell it. Go
      and see your niece to-morrow by all means,&mdash;or her guardians, if it
      seems necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry we are parting in this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must remember how difficult it is to keep one&rsquo;s temper under certain
      kinds of accusation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t accuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, to explain calmly that one couldn&rsquo;t commit this or that
      sordid rascality;&mdash;it comes to the same thing. However, I am obliged
      to you for opening my eyes. I have got into a very foolish position, and I
      promise you I will get out of it as quickly as may be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he bowed his leave-taking, and withdrew.

      CHAPTER 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not yet dark, but street-lamps had begun to flare and flicker in
      the gust of a cold, damp evening. A thin and slippery mud smeared the
      pavement. Tarrant had walked mechanically as far as to the top of Park
      Lane before he began to consider his immediate course. Among the people
      who stood waiting for omnibuses, he meditated thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She may not get home until seven or half-past; then she will have a meal.
      I had better put it off till about half-past eight. That leaves me some
      four hours to dispose of. First of all I&rsquo;ll walk home, and&mdash;yes, by
      all the devils! I&rsquo;ll finish that bit of writing. A year ago I could no
      more have done it, under such circumstances, than have built a suspension
      bridge. To-day I will&mdash;just to show that I&rsquo;ve some grit in me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Down Park Lane, and by Buckingham Palace across to Westminster, he kept
      his thoughts for the most part on that bit of writing. Only thus could he
      save himself from an access of fury which would only have injured him&mdash;the
      ire of shame in which a man is tempted to beat his head against stone
      walls. He composed aloud, balancing many a pretty antithesis, and
      polishing more than one lively paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his bedroom-study the fire had gone out. No matter; he would write in
      the cold. It was mere amanuensis work, penning at the dictation of his
      sarcastic demon. Was he a sybarite? Many a poor scribbler has earned bed
      and breakfast with numb fingers. The fire in his body would serve him for
      an hour or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sat down, and achieved his task to the last syllable. He read it
      through, corrected it, made it up for post, and rose with the plaudits of
      conscience. &lsquo;Who shall say now that I am a fop and a weakling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past seven. Good; just time enough to appease his hunger and reach
      Grove Lane by the suitable hour. He went out to the little coffee-shop
      which was his resort in Spartan moods, ate with considerable appetite, and
      walked over Westminster Bridge to the Camberwell tram. To kill time on the
      journey he bought a halfpenny paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ascended Grove Lane his heart throbbed more than the exercise
      warranted. At the door of the house, which he had never yet entered, and
      which he had not looked upon for more than a year, he stood to calm
      himself, with lips set and cheek pale in the darkness. Then a confident
      peal at the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mary who opened. He had never seen her, but knew that this grave,
      hard-featured person, not totally unlike a born gentlewoman, must be Mary
      Woodruff. And in her eyes he read a suspicion of his own identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Miss. Lord at home?&rsquo; he asked, in a matter-of-fact way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&mdash;What name shall I mention?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tarrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell, and she requested him to enter, to wait in the hall for a
      moment; then went upstairs. She was absent for a few minutes, and on
      returning asked him to follow her. She led to the drawing-room: on the
      way, Tarrant felt a surprise that in so small a house the drawing-room
      should be correctly situated on the upper floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he had again to wait. A comfortable room, he thought, and with a true
      air of home about it. He knew how significant is this impression first
      received on entering a strange abode; home or encampment, attraction or
      repulsion, according to the mind of the woman who rules there. Was it
      Nancy, or Mary, who made the atmosphere of the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and he faced towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s dress had an emphasis of fashion formerly unknown to it;
      appropriate enough considering her new occupation. The flush upon her
      cheeks, the light of doubtful meaning in her eyes, gave splendour to a
      beauty matured by motherhood. In the dark street, a fortnight ago, Tarrant
      could hardly be said to have seen her; he gazed in wonder and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has brought you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cause quite sufficient.&mdash;This is a little house; can we talk
      without being overheard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can shout if you wish to,&rsquo; she answered flippantly. &lsquo;The servant is
      Out, and Mary is downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy did not seat herself, and offered no seat to the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why have you made yourself a shop-girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that I had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am told you go daily to some shop or other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am engaged at a place of business, but I don&rsquo;t.&mdash;However, that
      doesn&rsquo;t matter. What business is it of yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is Mr. Luckworth Crewe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy kept her eyes still more resolutely fronting his severe look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man I used to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t see him now-a-days?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s many months since I saw him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who, then, is the woman who has told him your whole story&mdash;with
      embellishments, and who says she has had it from you yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say there is any such person,&rsquo; Tarrant continued. &lsquo;The man may
      have lied in that particular. But he has somehow got to know a good deal
      about you,&mdash;where and when your child was born, where it is now,
      where I live, and so on. And all this he has reported to your aunt, Mrs.
      Damerel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To her?&mdash;How do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer he held out Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s note of invitation, then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been with her this afternoon. She is coming to offer you her
      protection against the scoundrel who has ruined you, and who is now living
      upon you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the form the story has taken, either in Mr. Crewe&rsquo;s mind, or in
      that of the woman who told it to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they know that I am married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they think you&mdash;are having money from me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how they explain your taking a place in a shop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed, and laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How ridiculous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you can get amusement out of it. Perhaps you can suggest how the
      joke began?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved a few steps, then turned again to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know who the woman must be. It&rsquo;s Beatrice French.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bosom friend of yours, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have taken her into your confidence&mdash;up to a certain point?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have told her. And she told Mr. Crewe? I understand that. Well,
      what does it matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant was at a loss to interpret this singular levity. He had never
      truly believed that reading of Nancy&rsquo;s character by means of which he
      tried to persuade himself that his marriage was an unmitigated calamity,
      and a final parting between them the best thing that could happen. His
      memories of her, and the letters she had written him, coloured her
      personality far otherwise. Yet was not the harsh judgment after all the
      true one?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that people think you an unmarried
      mother,&mdash;that people are talking about you with grins and sneers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy reddened in angry shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them talk!&rsquo; she exclaimed violently. &lsquo;What does it matter, so long as
      they don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So long as they don&rsquo;t know?&mdash;How came you to tell this woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you suppose I told her for amusement? She found out what had happened
      at Falmouth,&mdash;found out simply by going down there and making
      inquiries; because she suspected me of some secret affair with a man she
      wants to marry herself&mdash;this Mr. Crewe. The wonder of wonders is that
      no one else got to know of it in that way. Any one who cared much what
      happened to me would have seen the all but impossibility of keeping such a
      secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a notable instance of evolutionary process that the female mind, in
      wrath, flies to just those logical ineptitudes which most surely
      exasperate the male intelligence. Tarrant gave a laugh of irate scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you told me the other day that I cared particularly whether your
      secret was discovered or not&mdash;that I only married you in the hope of
      profiting by it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t any woman think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not. I believe there are some women who don&rsquo;t rush naturally to a
      base supposition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I?&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed, with a vehement passion that made her breast
      heave. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I give you time enough&mdash;believe in you until I could
      believe no longer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of her thrilling voice went to Tarrant&rsquo;s heart, and his head
      drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may be true,&rsquo; he said gravely. &lsquo;But go on with your explanation.
      This woman came to you, and told you what she had discovered?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you allowed her to think you unmarried?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What choice had I? How was my child to be brought up if I lost
      everything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God, Nancy! Did you imagine I should leave you to starve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His emotion, his utterance of her name, caused her to examine him with a
      kind of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did I know?&mdash;How could I tell, at that time, whether you were
      alive or dead?&mdash;I had to think of myself and the child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor girl!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words fell from him involuntarily. Nancy&rsquo;s look became as scornful and
      defiant as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that was nothing. I&rsquo;ve gone through a good deal more than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop. Tell me this. Have you in your anger&mdash;anger natural enough&mdash;allowed
      yourself to speak to any one about me in the way I should never forgive?
      In the spirit of your letter, I mean. Did you give this Beatrice French
      any ground for thinking that I made a speculation of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said nothing of that kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor to any one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To no one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you told this woman where I was living, and that I had been abroad
      for a long time. Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I told her so much about you,&rsquo; Nancy replied. &lsquo;Not when she first
      came to me, but afterwards&mdash;only the other day. I wanted employment,
      and didn&rsquo;t know how to get it, except through her. She promised me a place
      if I would disclose your name; not that she knew or cared anything about
      <i>you</i>, but because she still had suspicions about Mr. Crewe. I was
      desperate, and I told her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Desperate? Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I make you understand what I have gone through? What do you care?
      And what do <i>I</i> care whether you understand or not? It wasn&rsquo;t for
      money, and Beatrice French knew it wasn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it must have been that you could not bear the monotony of your
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was a short, careless laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is this shop? What do you do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a dress-supply association. I advise fools about the fashions, and
      exhibit myself as a walking fashion-plate. I can&rsquo;t see how it should
      interest you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever concerns you, Nancy, interests me more than anything else in the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What more do you want to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half turned from him, leaning at the mantelpiece, a foot on the
      fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said just now that you have gone through worse things than the shame
      of being thought unmarried. Tell me about it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I, indeed. When I was willing to tell you everything, you didn&rsquo;t care
      to hear it. It&rsquo;s too late now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not too late, happily, to drag you out of this wretched slough into
      which you are sinking. Whatever the cost, <i>that</i> shall be done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, I am not disposed to let any one drag me anywhere. I want no
      help; and if I did, you would be the last person I should accept it from.
      I don&rsquo;t know why you came here after the agreement we made the other
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant stepped towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to find out whether you were telling lies about me, and I should
      never have thought it possible but for my bad conscience. I know you had
      every excuse for being embittered and for acting revengefully. It seems
      you have only told lies about yourself. As, after all, you are my wife, I
      shan&rsquo;t allow that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she turned upon him passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am <i>not</i> your wife! You married me against your will, and shook me
      off as soon as possible. I won&rsquo;t be bound to you; I shall act as a free
      woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bound to me you are, and shall be&mdash;as I to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say it fifty times, and it will mean nothing.&mdash;How bound to
      you? Bound to share my money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgive you that, because I have treated you ill. You don&rsquo;t mean it
      either. You know I am incapable of such a thought. But that shall very
      soon be put right. Your marriage shall be made known at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Known to whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the people concerned&mdash;to your guardians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rsquo; she answered, with a smile. &lsquo;They know it
      already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant half closed his eyes as he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of such a silly falsehood?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you I had gone through a good deal more than you imagined. I have
      struggled to keep my money, in spite of shames and miseries, and I will
      have it for myself&mdash;and my child! If you want to know the truth, go
      to Samuel Barmby, and ask him what he has had to do with me. I owe no
      explanation to <i>you</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant could see her face only in profile. Marvelling at the
      complications she gradually revealed, he felt his blood grow warm with
      desire of her beauty. She was his wife, yet guarded as by maidenhood. A
      familiar touch would bring the colour to her cheeks, the light of
      resentment to her eyes. Passion made him glad of the estrangement which
      compelled a new wooing, and promised, on her part, a new surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t owe it me, Nancy; but if I beg you to tell me all&mdash;because
      I have come to my senses again&mdash;because I know how foolish and cruel
      I have been&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember what we agreed. Go your way, and let me go mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no idea of what I was agreeing to. I took it for granted that your
      marriage was strictly a secret, and that you might be free in the real
      sense if you chose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and you were quite willing, because it gave you your freedom as
      well. I am as free as I wish to be. I have made a life for myself that
      satisfies me&mdash;and now you come to undo everything. I won&rsquo;t be
      tormented&mdash;I have endured enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then only one course is open to me. I shall publish your marriage
      everywhere. I shall make a home for you, and have the child brought to it;
      then come or not, as you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At mention of the child Nancy regarded him with cold curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you to make a home for me? I thought you had difficulty enough in
      supporting yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no concern of yours. It shall be done, and in a day or two. Then
      make your choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think I can be forced to live with a man I don&rsquo;t love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of living with a woman who didn&rsquo;t love me. But you are
      married, and a mother, and the secrecy that is degrading you shall come to
      an end. Acknowledge me or not, I shall acknowledge <i>you</i>, and make it
      known that I am to blame for all that has happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what good will you do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do good to myself, at all events. I&rsquo;m a selfish fellow, and shall
      be so to the end, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy glanced at him to interpret the speech by his expression. He was
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What good will it do you to have to support me? The selfishness I see in
      it is your wishing to take me from a comfortable home and make me poor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That can&rsquo;t be helped. And, what&rsquo;s more, you won&rsquo;t think it a hardship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know that? I have borne dreadful degradations rather than lose
      my money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was for the child&rsquo;s sake, not for your own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it softly and kindly, and for the first time Nancy met his eyes
      without defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was; I could always have earned my own living, somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant paused a moment, then spoke with look averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he well, and properly cared for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he were not well and safe, I shouldn&rsquo;t be away from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When will you let me see him, Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not smile, but there was a brightening of her countenance, which
      she concealed. Tarrant stepped to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear&mdash;my own love&mdash;will you try to forgive me? It was all my
      cursed laziness. It would never have happened if I hadn&rsquo;t fallen into
      poverty. Poverty is the devil, and it overcame me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you think that <i>I</i> shall be strong enough to face it?&rsquo; she
      asked, moving half a step away. &lsquo;Leave me to myself; I am contented; I
      have made up my mind about what is before me, and I won&rsquo;t go through all
      that again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of standing, she dropped upon the nearest chair, and lay back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be contented, Nancy, in a position that dishonours you. From
      what you tell me, it seems that your secret is no secret at all. Will you
      compel me to go to that man Barmby and seek information from him about my
      own wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had to do worse things than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture me by such vague hints. I entreat you to tell me at once
      the worst that you have suffered. How did Barmby get to know of your
      marriage? And why has he kept silent about it? There can&rsquo;t be anything
      that you are ashamed to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. The shame is all yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take it upon myself, all of it; I ought never to have left you; but
      that baseness followed only too naturally on the cowardice which kept me
      from declaring our marriage when honour demanded it. I have played a
      contemptible part in this story; don&rsquo;t refuse to help me now that I am
      ready to behave more like a man. Put your hand in mine, and let us be
      friends, if we mayn&rsquo;t be more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat irresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were a brave girl. You consented to my going away because it seemed
      best, and I took advantage of your sincerity. Often enough that last look
      of yours has reproached me. I wonder how I had the heart to leave you
      alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy raised herself, and said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was what I might have expected. I had only my own folly to thank. You
      behaved as most men would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a harder reproach than any yet. Tarrant winced under it. He would
      much rather have been accused of abnormal villainy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I was foolish,&rsquo; continued Nancy, &lsquo;in more ways than you knew. You
      feared I had told Jessica Morgan of our marriage, and you were right; of
      course I denied it. She has been the cause of my worst trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In rapid sentences she told the story of her successive humiliations,
      recounted her sufferings at the hands of Jessica and Beatrice and Samuel
      Barmby. When she ceased, there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Barmby been here again?&rsquo; Tarrant asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He has been twice, and talked in just the same way, and I had to sit
      still before him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he said one word that&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she interrupted hastily. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s only a fool&mdash;not man enough
      to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That saves me trouble,&rsquo; said Tarrant; &lsquo;I have only to treat him like a
      fool. My poor darling, what vile torments you have endured! And you
      pretend that you would rather live on this fellow&rsquo;s interested generosity&mdash;for,
      of course, he hopes to be rewarded&mdash;than throw the whole squalid
      entanglement behind you and be a free, honest woman, even if a poor one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see no freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have lost all your love for me. Well, I can&rsquo;t complain of that. But
      bear my name you shall, and be supported by me. I tell you that it was
      never <i>possible</i> for me actually to desert you and the little one&mdash;never
      possible. I shirked a duty as long as I could; that&rsquo;s all it comes to. I
      loafed and paltered until the want of a dinner drove me into honesty. Try
      to forget it, dear Nancy. Try to forgive me, my dearest!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dry-eyed again, and his appeal seemed to have no power over her
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are forgetting,&rsquo; she said practically, &lsquo;that I have lived on money to
      which I had no right, and that I&mdash;or you&mdash;can be forced to repay
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Repaid it must be, whether demanded or not. Where does Barmby live?
      Perhaps I could see him to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What means have you of keeping us all alive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some of my work has been accepted here and there; but there&rsquo;s something
      else I have in mind. I don&rsquo;t ask you to become a poverty-stricken wife in
      the ordinary way. I can&rsquo;t afford to take a house. I must put you, with the
      child, into as good lodgings as I can hope to pay for, and work on by
      myself, just seeing you as often as you will let me. Even if you were
      willing, it would be a mistake for us to live together. For one thing, I
      couldn&rsquo;t work under such conditions; for another, it would make you a
      slave. Tell me: are you willing to undertake the care of the child, if
      nothing else is asked of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy gave him a disdainful smile, a smile like those of her girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite so feeble a creature as you think me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would rather have the child to yourself, than be living away from
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have made up your mind, why trouble to ask such questions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I have no wish to force burdens upon you. You said just now that
      you could see little prospect of freedom in such a life as I have to offer
      you. I thought you perhaps meant that the care of the child would&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant nothing,&rsquo; Nancy broke in, with fretful impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he&mdash;our boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Dulwich. I told you that in my last letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes. I thought you might have changed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have found a better, kinder woman. Can you guess how many
      answers I had to the advertisement? Thirty-two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course five-and-twenty of them took it for granted you would pay so
      much a week and ask no questions. They would just not have starved the
      baby,&mdash;unless you had hinted to them that you were willing to pay a
      lump sum for a death-certificate, in which case the affair would have been
      more or less skilfully managed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary knew all about that. She came from Falmouth, and spent two days in
      visiting people. I knew I could rely on her judgment. There were only four
      or five people she cared to see at all, and of these only one that seemed
      trustworthy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure. One out of two-and-thirty. A higher percentage than would
      apply to mankind at large, I dare say. By-the-bye, I was afraid you might
      have found a difficulty in registering the birth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I went to the office myself, the morning that I was leaving Falmouth,
      and the registrar evidently knew nothing about me. It isn&rsquo;t such a small
      place that everybody living there is noticed and talked of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Mary took the child straight to Dulwich?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two days before I came,&mdash;so as to have the house ready for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it was unfortunate, Nancy, that you had so good a friend. But for
      that, I should have suffered more uneasiness about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered with energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no husband in the world worth such a friend as Mary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Tarrant first smiled, then laughed. Nancy kept her lips rigid. It
      happened that he again saw her face in exact profile, and again it warmed
      the current of his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some day you shall think better of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paid no attention. Watching her, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you thinking of so earnestly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was delayed a little, but she said at length, with an absent
      manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace might lend me the money to pay back what I owe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your brother?&mdash;If he can afford it, there would be less objection to
      that than to any other plan I can think of. But I must ask it myself; you
      shall beg no more favours. I will ask it in your presence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do nothing of the kind,&rsquo; Nancy replied drily. &lsquo;If you think to
      please me by humiliating yourself, you are very much mistaken. And you
      mustn&rsquo;t imagine that I put myself into your hands to be looked after as
      though I had no will of my own. With the past you have nothing to do,&mdash;with
      <i>my</i> past, at all events. Care for the future as you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I must see your guardians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I won&rsquo;t have that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up to emphasise her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must. It&rsquo;s the only way in which I can satisfy myself&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I refuse to take a step,&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;Leave all that to me, and I
      will go to live where you please, and never grumble, however poor I am.
      Interfere, and I will go on living as now, on Samuel Barmby&rsquo;s generosity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking her resolution. Tarrant hesitated, and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long, then, before you act?&rsquo; he inquired abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When my new home is found, I am ready to go there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will deal honestly with me? You will tell every one, and give up
      everything not strictly yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done with lies,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank heaven, so have I!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the final tempest in De Crespigny Park there followed, for Arthur
      Peachey, a calmer and happier season than he had ever known. To have acted
      with stern resolve is always a satisfaction, especially to the man
      conscious of weak good-nature, and condemned for the most part to yield.
      In his cheap lodging at Clapham, Peachey awoke each morning with a vague
      sense of joy, which became delight as soon as he had collected his senses.
      He was a free man. No snarl greeted him as he turned his head upon the
      pillow; he could lie and meditate, could rise quietly when the moment
      sounded, could go downstairs to a leisurely meal, cheered perhaps by a
      letter reporting that all was well with his dear little son. Simple,
      elementary pleasures, but how he savoured them after his years of sordid
      bondage!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the blessedness of divorce, without squalid publicity. It was the
      vast relief of widowerhood, without dreary memories of death and burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      In releasing himself from such companionship, the man felt as though he
      had washed and become clean.

    <p>
      Innocent of scientific speculation, he had the misfortune about this time
      to read in paper or magazine something on the subject of heredity, the
      idle verbiage of some half-informed scribbler. It set him anxiously
      thinking whether his son would develop the vices of the mother&rsquo;s mind, and
      from that day he read all the printed chatter regarding natural
      inheritance that he could lay his hands on. The benefit he derived from
      this course of study was neither more nor less than might have been
      expected; it supplied him with a new trouble, which sometimes kept him
      wakeful. He could only resolve that his boy should have the best education
      procurable for money, if he starved himself in providing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to live with the utmost economy, and for a twofold reason:
      the business of Messrs Ducker, Blunt &amp; Co. threatened a decline, and,
      this apart, he desired to get out of it, to obtain an interest in some
      more honourable concern. For a long time it had been known to him that the
      disinfectants manufactured by his firm were far from trustworthy, and of
      late the complaints of purchasers had become frequent. With the
      manufacturing department he had nothing to do; he tried to think himself
      free from responsibility; for, in spite of amiable qualities, he was a man
      of business, and saw a great part of life through the commercial
      spectacles commonly worn now-a-days. Nevertheless conscience unsettled
      him. One day he heard his partners joking over the legislative omission by
      virtue of which they were able to adulterate their disinfectants to any
      extent without fear of penalty; their laughter grated upon him, and he got
      out of the way. If he could lay aside a few thousands of pounds, assuredly
      his connection with the affair should be terminated. So he lived, for his
      own part, on a pound a week, and informed Ada through his solicitor that
      she must be satisfied with a certain very moderate allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peachey naturally laid herself out to give every one as much trouble
      as possible. Insulting post-cards showered upon her husband at his place
      of business. After a few weeks she discovered his lodging, and addressed
      the post-cards thither; but she made no attempt at personal molestation.
      The loss of her child gave her not the slightest concern, yet she
      determined to find out where the boy was living. She remembered that
      Peachey had relatives at Canterbury, and after a troublesome search
      succeeded in her purpose. An interview with her husband&rsquo;s married sister
      proved so unsatisfactory to Ada, that she had recourse to her familiar
      weapons, rage, insult, and menace; with the result that she was forcibly
      removed, and made a scandal in the quiet street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she consulted men of law, and found one who encouraged her to sue for
      restitution of conjugal rights. It came to nothing, however; for in the
      meantime she was growing tired of her solitary existence,&mdash;friends of
      course she had none,&mdash;and the spirit moved her to try a change of
      tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote a long, long letter, penitent, tear-bestained. &lsquo;I have behaved
      outrageously to you, dearest Arthur; I must have been mad to say and do
      such things. The doctor tells me that my health has been in a very bad
      state for a long time, and I really don&rsquo;t remember half that has happened.
      You were quite right when you told me that I should be better if I didn&rsquo;t
      live such an idle life, and I have quite, quite made up my mind to be an
      industrious and a <i>good</i> woman. All yesterday I spent in needlework
      and crying. Oh, the tears that I have shed! My darling husband, what can I
      do to win your forgiveness? Do consider how lonely I am in this house.
      Beatrice has been horrid to me. If I said all I think about <i>her</i>,
      she wouldn&rsquo;t like to hear it; but I am learning to control my tongue. She
      lives alone in a flat, and has men to spend every evening with her; it&rsquo;s
      disgraceful! And there&rsquo;s Fanny, who I am sure is leading an immoral life
      abroad. Of course I shall never speak to her again. You were quite right
      when you said my sisters were worthless.&rsquo;&mdash;Peachey had never
      permitted himself any such remark.&mdash;&lsquo;I will have no one but you, my
      dear, good, sweet husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So on, over several pages. Reading it, the husband stood aghast at this
      new revelation of female possibilities; at the end, he hurriedly threw it
      into the fire, fearing, and with good reason, that weakness in his own
      character to which the woman addressed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day for a week there arrived a replica of this epistle, and at
      length he answered. It was the fatal concession. Though he wrote with
      almost savage severity, Ada replied in terms of exuberant gratitude. Oh,
      how delighted she was to see his dear handwriting once more! How it
      reminded her of happy days, when they loved each other so tenderly! Then
      came two strophes of a sentimental drawing-room song, and lastly, an
      impassioned appeal to be allowed to see her husband, were it only for five
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another week of such besieging, and the poor fellow&rsquo;s foolish heart gave
      way. He would see the wretched woman, and tell her that, though never
      could he consent to live with her again, he had no malicious feeling, and
      was willing to be her friend at a distance. So, at six o&rsquo;clock one
      evening, behold him tremulously approaching the house in De Crespigny
      Park,&mdash;tremulously, because he dreaded the assault upon his emotions
      to which he so recklessly exposed himself. He was admitted by a very young
      servant, in a very clean cap and apron. Silence possessed the dwelling; he
      did not venture to tread with natural step. He entered the drawing-room,
      and there, from amid a heap of household linen which required the needle,
      rose the penitent wife. Ostentatiously she drew from her finger a thimble,
      then advanced with head bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How kind of you, Arthur! How&mdash;how very&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was dissolved in tears&mdash;so genuine, that they marked pale
      rillets across the bloom of her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a month after that the furniture was removed from De Crespigny Park
      to a much smaller house at Brixton, where Mr. and Mrs. Peachey took up
      their abode together. A medical man shortly called, and Ada, not without
      secret disgust, smilingly made known to her husband that she must now be
      very careful of her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one point only the man had held to a rational resolve; he would not
      allow his little son to be brought back to London, away from the home
      where he was happy and thriving. Out of mere self-will Ada strove for a
      long time to overcome this decision; finding argument and artifice of no
      avail, she dropped the matter. Peachey owed this triumph largely to the
      firm commonsense of his sister, who plainly refused to let the little
      fellow quit her care for that of such a woman as he was unfortunate enough
      to call mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas came, and with it an unanticipated call from Miss. Fanny French,
      who said she had lately recovered from a serious illness in Paris; the
      nature of her malady she did not specify; it had left her haggard and
      thin, but by no means deficient in vivacity. She was dressed with tawdry
      extravagance, wore a mass of false yellow hair, had her eyebrows dyed
      black,&mdash;piquant contrast,&mdash;and her cheeks and lips richly
      carmined. No veritable information as to her past and present could be
      gleaned from the mixture of French and English which she ceaselessly
      gabbled. She had come over for Christmas, that was all; could not dream of
      returning to live in wretched England. At Brussels and in Paris she had
      made hosts of friends, just the right sort of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada told her all the news. Of most interest was that which related to
      Nancy Lord. Only a month ago it had become known that Nancy was married,
      and the mother of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Barmbys found it out somehow,&rsquo; Ada narrated. &lsquo;She was married to a
      man called Tarrant, some one we never heard of, on the very day of her
      father&rsquo;s death, and, of course, before she knew anything about his will.
      Then, of course, it had to be kept dark, or she&rsquo;d lose all her money. Her
      husband hadn&rsquo;t a farthing. She supported him, and they say he lived most
      of the time in her house. He&rsquo;s a regular scamp, a drinking, betting
      fellow. Well, it all came out, and the Barmbys turned her into the street
      at a moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;serve her right!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny shrieked with merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is she doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She went on her knees to Beatrice, and begged for a place at the shop, if
      it was only a few shillings a week. Nice come-down for Nancy Lord, wasn&rsquo;t
      it? Of course Beatrice sent her off with a flea in her ear. I don&rsquo;t know
      where she&rsquo;s living, but I&rsquo;ve heard that her husband has gone to America,
      and left her to shift for herself, now there&rsquo;s nothing more to be got out
      of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For supplementary details of this racy narrative, Fanny sought out
      Beatrice; but to her astonishment and annoyance Beatrice would tell
      nothing. The elder sister urged Fanny to give an account of herself, and
      used some very plain speech of the admonitory kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has become of that jackanapes, Horace Lord?&rsquo; asked Fanny, after a
      contemptuous remark about &lsquo;sermons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The question is, what&rsquo;s going to become of <i>you</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the girl grew vituperative in two languages, and made off. Her
      relatives saw no more of her for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. Peachey was born a daughter. Naturally, the months preceding this
      event had been, for her husband, a renewal of martyrdom; his one
      supporting solace lay in the thought of the little lad at Canterbury. All
      the old troubles were revived; from morning to night the house rang with
      brawls between mistress and servants; in the paroxysms favoured by her
      physical condition, Ada behaved like a candidate for Bedlam, and more than
      once obliged her husband to seek temporary peace in lodgings. He left home
      at eight o&rsquo;clock every morning, and returned as late as possible. The
      necessity of passing long evenings made him haunt places of entertainment,
      and he sometimes had recourse to drink,&mdash;he by nature the soberest of
      men,&mdash;in fear of what awaited him on his tardy appearance at Brixton.
      A month after Ada&rsquo;s confinement he once more acted a sane part, and
      announced by letter that he would die rather than continue living with his
      wife. As it was fine autumn weather he went down to a seaside place, where
      his Canterbury relatives and the little boy joined him for a holiday of
      several weeks. Again Ada was to receive an allowance. She despatched a few
      very virulent post-cards, but presently grew quiet, and appeared to accept
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early winter Fanny French came over to England. She had again been ill,
      and this time with results obviously graver. Her first call was upon
      Beatrice, who still occupied the flat at Brixton, and here she unbosomed
      herself of a dolorous story. All her money had vanished; stolen, most of
      it, Fanny declared; she was without resources, and, as any one could see,
      in a wretched state of health. Would Beatrice have compassion on her?
      Would she lend her money till she was well enough to &lsquo;look round&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss. French at once took the girl into her own home, and had her looked
      after. Fanny coughed in an alarming way; the doctor, speaking privately
      with Beatrice, made an unpleasant report; was it possible to send the
      patient to a mild climate for the winter months? Yes, Miss. French could
      manage that, and would. A suitable attendant having been procured, Fanny
      was despatched to Bournemouth, whence, in a day or two, she wrote to her
      sister thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been awfully kind to me, and I shan&rsquo;t forget it when I&rsquo;m well
      again. Feel a good deal fitter already. Dullish place this, but I&rsquo;ve got
      to put up with it. I&rsquo;ve had a letter from Ada. If you see her, tell her
      she&rsquo;s a beast, and I wish Arthur would wring her scraggy neck. She says
      it&rsquo;s all my own fault; wait till I&rsquo;m back again, and I&rsquo;ll pay her a call.
      My own fault indeed! It seems to me I&rsquo;m very much to be pitied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking one day along the sea-front by herself, Fanny observed a young
      man&rsquo;s figure a few paces in advance of her, which seemed to awaken
      recollections. Presently the young man turned and showed, beyond doubt,
      the countenance of Horace Lord. He met her eyes, gave a doubtful, troubled
      look, and was going past when Fanny accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it <i>is</i>&mdash;it really <i>is</i>! How glad I am to see you!
      But what on earth are you doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amusing myself&mdash;<i>comme vous voyez</i>; and you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, doing the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had shaken hands, and were sauntering on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything wrong with your health?&rsquo; Fanny asked, scrutinising the pale thin
      face, with its touch of warmth on the cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a cold; nothing to speak of. You been out of
      sorts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little run down. Over-study, they say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t know you went in for that kind of thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve been studying abroad for a long time. Thinking of taking
      a place as French teacher in some tip-top high school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad to hear it. Capital idea. Sure I hope you&rsquo;ll be
      successful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks awf&rsquo;ly. Tell me something about yourself. Why, it&rsquo;s two years
      since we saw each other, isn&rsquo;t it? Are you married yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled and coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;not yet. I&rsquo;m in business with Luckworth Crewe,&mdash;sort of
      sleeping partner just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you really? And how&rsquo;s your sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man bent his brows uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anything about her?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a man called Tarrant. Very clever fellow; he writes for the papers.&mdash;I
      say, Miss. French, I generally have a glass of wine and a biscuit, at the
      confectioner&rsquo;s, about this time. Will you give me the pleasure of your
      company?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Charmee</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>! I generally go in for the same kind of
      thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they repaired to the cake-shop, and sat talking for half-an-hour of
      trifles which made them laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you really didn&rsquo;t know me?&rsquo; said Fanny, when her glass of wine was
      finished. &lsquo;Have I changed so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good deal. Not for the worse, oh dear no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind saying that <i>you</i> have changed a good deal for
      the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace flushed at the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m much older,&rsquo; he answered with a sigh, as though the years of a
      sexagenarian weighed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I like in you. You&rsquo;re so much more of a man. Don&rsquo;t be
      offended.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went forth again into the sunshine. At the door both coughed, and
      both pretended that it wasn&rsquo;t a cough at all, but a voluntary little hem.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel was younger than ever. She had spent October abroad, with her
      friends Mrs. and Miss. Chittle, and the greater part of November at
      Brighton, with other friends. Back in town she established herself at one
      of the various boarding-houses honoured by her patronage, and prepared to
      enjoy the social life of winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a year ago an unwonted depression had troubled her serene existence.
      At the close of the London season she seemed weary and spiritless, very
      unlike herself; having no invitation for the next two months, she withdrew
      to Whitsand, and there spent some cheerless weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitsand was the as yet unfashionable seaside place which had attracted
      the speculative eye of Luckworth Crewe. For the past two years he had been
      trying to inspire certain men of capital with his own faith in the
      possibilities of Whitsand; he owned a share in the new hotel just opened;
      whenever his manifold affairs allowed him a day&rsquo;s holiday, he spent it at
      Whitsand, pacing the small esplanade, and meditating improvements. That
      these &lsquo;improvements&rsquo; signified the conversion of a pretty little old-world
      spot into a hideous brand new resort of noisy hordes, in no degree
      troubled Mr. Crewe&rsquo;s conscience. For his own part, he could appreciate the
      charms of Whitsand as it stood; he was by no means insensible to natural
      beauty and the ancient peace which so contrasted with his life of every
      day; but first and foremost in his mind came the necessity of making
      money; and to fill his pockets he would no more hesitate about destroying
      the loveliest spot on earth, than the starving hunter would stay his hand
      out of admiration for bird or beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with much delight that he heard of Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s retreat to
      Whitsand. To the note in which she acquainted him with her arrival there
      he replied effusively. &lsquo;The patronage of a few really fashionable people,
      such as yourself, would soon do wonders. We must have a special paragraph
      in the local paper, drawing attention to your being there&rsquo;&mdash;and so
      on. An answer by return of post rather disappointed him. On no account,
      wrote Mrs. Damerel, must her name be specially mentioned in the paper. She
      had taken very simple lodgings, very inexpensive, and wished to live as
      quietly as possible. But, after seeing the place, she quite agreed with Mr
      Crewe that it had a future, and if he could run down some day, whilst she
      was here, it would give her great pleasure to hear his projects explained
      on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe ran down. In speaking of Mrs. Damerel as a &lsquo;really fashionable&rsquo; 
      person, he used no insincerity; from their first meeting he had seen in
      this lady his ideal of social distinction; she was, in fact, the only
      woman of skilfully pretentious demeanour with whom he had ever spoken. Her
      distant likeness to Nancy Lord interested and attracted him; her suave
      superiority awed his conscious roughness; she seemed to him exquisitely
      gracious, wonderfully sweet. And as, little by little, he attained the
      right to think of her almost as a friend, his humble admiration became
      blended with feelings he took particular care not to betray, lest he
      should expose himself to ridicule. That her age exceeded his own by some
      years he was of course aware, but this fact soon dropped out of his mind,
      and never returned to it. Not only did he think Mrs. Damerel a type of
      aristocratic beauty, he saw in her countenance all the freshness and the
      promise of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight mystery attaching to her position only increased his
      susceptibility to her charms. It seemed to him very probable that she had
      but a moderate income; perhaps she was not free from anxieties on that
      score. But such a woman would of course marry again, and marry well. The
      thought grew troublesome, and presently accounted for ebullitions of
      wrath, accompanied by more than usually vigorous language, when business
      matters went wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Whitsand, Mrs. Damerel showed herself more than ever sweetly affable.
      The season, she said, had been rather too much for her; she must take care
      of her health; besides&mdash;and her smile played upon Crewe&rsquo;s pulses&mdash;there
      were troubles, cares, of which she could not speak <i>even</i> to so
      valued a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re anxious about your nephew,&rsquo; murmured the man of
      business; though at the same time he suspected other things, for the
      lodgings in which he found Mrs. Damerel were certainly modest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I trouble a good deal about him. If only dear Horace would be
      reconciled to me. It seems such a long, long time. You know that we have
      corresponded, but he refuses to see me. It pains me deeply, Mr Crewe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after a silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a special reason why I wish he would be friends with me,&mdash;a
      reason that concerns his own future. Why should I not tell you? I am sure
      you will respect my confidence.&mdash;He will very soon become
      independent, and then I do so fear he may make a foolish marriage. Yet all
      the time there is a chance waiting for him which would establish his
      fortune and his happiness for life. Did he ever speak to you of Miss.
      Chittle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a dear, sweet girl, and with really large means. He was introduced
      to her during the happy time when we saw so much of each other, and she at
      once became interested in him. Her dear mother assured me of it. She is a
      very shy, retiring girl, and has refused many offers, before and since
      then. Isn&rsquo;t it a pity? But I am losing all hope, and I so fear he may have
      formed some other attachment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe went back to London resolved that Horace Lord should no longer &lsquo;play
      the fool.&rsquo; And he was successful. Horace had all but lost his resentment
      against Mrs. Damerel; he kept aloof out of stubborn conceit&mdash;it had
      not dignity enough to be called pride; the same feeling that still
      estranged him from Nancy, though he would gladly have welcomed his
      sister&rsquo;s offer of affection. Persuaded, or commanded, by Luckworth Crewe,
      he took the train to Whitsand, and remained there for several days. Mrs.
      Damerel wrote her friend in Farringdon Street a letter of gratitude, which
      acted upon him like champagne. In a postscript she said: &lsquo;Mrs. Chittle and
      her daughter have consented to come here for a week or two. They will take
      rooms at the Imperial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of September, Horace Lord was engaged to Winifred Chittle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years had made very little change in Miss. Chittle&rsquo;s appearance. She
      was still colourless and abnormally shy, still had the look of one who
      sheds secret tears, and her repugnance to Society had, if possible,
      increased. Horace thought her pretty, was impressed by her extreme
      gentleness and refinement, but she obtained no power over his emotions
      such as that formerly exercised by Fanny French. It struck him, too, as a
      very strange thing, that a young lady with a large fortune should be
      willing to marry a man of his social insignificance. &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Damerel, &lsquo;it was a case of love at first sight.&rsquo; But Horace, who had
      gained some experience of life, could not believe this. He wooed, and won;
      yet even when Winifred accepted him, he felt that she did it under some
      constraint. Her pale face declared no happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she chosen, Mrs. Damerel could have explained the mystery. She knew
      that, several years ago, Winifred&rsquo;s name had been blighted by a scandal,
      and that the girl&rsquo;s shrinking from every proposal of marriage was due, in
      part perhaps, to the memory of love betrayed, in part to a sense of
      honour, and to the suspicion that men, knowing her disgrace, condoned it
      for the sake of her wealth. Interest made Mrs. Damerel generous; she
      admitted every excuse for Winifred, and persuaded herself that in
      procuring Horace such a wife she was doing him only a nominal wrong. The
      young people could live apart from that corner of Society in which Miss.
      Chittle&rsquo;s name gave occasion to smiles or looks of perfunctory censure. If
      Winifred, after marriage, chose to make confession, why, that was her own
      affair, and Horace would be wise enough, all advantages considered, to
      take the matter philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the view of a practical-minded observer. To read Winifred
      perfectly, there needed a much more subtle and sympathetic intelligence.
      The girl had, in truth, conceived a liking for Horace Lord, and it grew
      stronger when she learnt that neither by birth nor present circumstances
      did he belong to her own world. To please her mother she was willing to
      take a husband, but the husband must be of her own choice. She wished to
      enter upon a wholly new life, remote from the social conditions which of
      late years had crushed her spirit. From the men who had hitherto
      approached her, she shrank in fear. Horace Lord, good-looking and not
      uneducated, yet so far from formidable, suggested a new hope; even though
      he might be actuated by the ordinary motives, she discerned in him a
      softness, a pliability of nature, which would harmonise with her own timid
      disposition. To the thought of deceiving him on the subject of her past,
      she was reconciled by a resolve to make his happiness the sole object of
      her existence in the future. Horace was amiability itself, and seemed, if
      not to love her ardently (which, perhaps, she did not even desire), at
      least to regard her with an increasing affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was said about the condition of the prospective bridegroom&rsquo;s
      health, though Horace had confided to Mrs. Damerel that he suffered from a
      troublesome cough, accompanied now and then by an alarming symptom. In her
      boundless exultation at the end achieved, Mrs. Damerel made light of this
      complaint. Horace was not free to marry until nearly the end of the year;
      for, though money would henceforth be no matter of anxiety, he might as
      well secure the small inheritance presently due to him. November and
      December he should spend at Bournemouth under the best medical care, and
      after that, if needful, his wife would go with him to Madeira or some such
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Mrs. Damerel could think of nothing but the great fact that
      Horace had secured a fortune. Her own resources were coming to an end, and
      but for the certainty that Horace would not grudge her an ample provision,
      she must at this moment have been racking her brains (even as through the
      summer) for help against the evil that drew near. Constitutional lightness
      of heart had enabled her to enjoy life on a steadily, and rapidly,
      diminishing fund. There had been hope in Nancy&rsquo;s direction, as well as in
      her brother&rsquo;s; but the disclosure of Nancy&rsquo;s marriage, and Horace&rsquo;s
      persistency in unfriendliness, brought Mrs. Damerel to a sense of peril.
      One offer of marriage she had received and declined; it came from a man of
      advanced years and small property. Another offer she might, or thought she
      might, at any moment provoke; but only in direst extremity could she think
      of bestowing her hand upon Luckworth Crewe. Crewe was in love with her, an
      amusing fact in itself, and especially so in regard to his former
      relations with Nancy Lord. He might become a wealthy man; on the other
      hand, he might not; and in any case he was a plebeian.
    </p>
    <p>
      All such miseries were now dismissed from her mind. She went abroad with
      the Chittles, enjoyed herself at Brighton, and came home to prepare for
      Horace&rsquo;s wedding, Horace himself being at Bournemouth. After her letter of
      gratitude to Crewe she had ceased to correspond with him; she did not
      trouble to acquaint him with Horace&rsquo;s engagement; and when Crewe, having
      heard the news from his partner, ventured to send her a letter of
      congratulation, Mrs. Damerel replied in two or three very civil but cold
      sentences. Back in London, she did not invite the man of projects to call
      upon her. The status she had lost when fears beset her must now be
      recovered. Let Crewe cherish a passion for her if he liked, but let him
      understand that social reasons made it laughably hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace was to come up to London in the third week of December, and to be
      married on New Year&rsquo;s Day; the honeymoon would be spent at Ventnor, or
      somewhere thereabout. Afraid to lose sight of her relative for more than a
      week or two, Mrs. Damerel had already been twice to Bournemouth, and now
      she decided to go for a third time, just to talk quietly over the
      forthcoming event, and, whether Horace broached the subject or not, to
      apprise him of the straits into which she was drifting. Unannounced by
      letter, she reached Bournemouth early in the afternoon, and went straight
      to Horace&rsquo;s lodgings. The young man had just finished luncheon, and, all
      things considered, including the fact that it was a remarkably bright and
      warm day for the time of year, he might have been expected to welcome Mrs.
      Damerel cheerfully. Yet on seeing her his countenance fell; he betrayed an
      embarrassment which the lady noted with anxious suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me, dear boy?&rsquo; she began, with a kiss upon his
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;oh yes. I never dreamt of your appearing just now, that was
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation. Such a morning in London! Almost as
      fine as it is here. And how is your cough?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as she made the inquiry, he answered it by coughing very badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think this place suits you, Horace,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel gravely.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not imprudent, I hope? Don&rsquo;t go out after dark?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was nothing, Horace maintained; for several days he had hardly
      coughed at all. But with every word he uttered, Mrs. Damerel became more
      convinced of something unusual in his state of mind; he could not keep
      still, and, in trying to put himself at ease, assumed strange postures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did you hear from Winifred?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yesterday&mdash;no, the day before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrank from her scrutiny, and an expression of annoyance began to
      disturb his features. Mrs. Damerel knew well enough the significance of
      that particular look; it meant the irritation of his self-will, the
      summoning of forces to resist something he disliked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There has been no difference between you, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;oh no,&rsquo; Horace replied, wriggling under her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a servant opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two ladies have called in a carriage, sir, and would like to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go down. Excuse me for a moment, aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are they, Horace?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Damerel, rising with an ill-concealed
      look of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some friends I have made here. I&rsquo;ll just go and speak to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried away. No sooner was he gone than Mrs. Damerel sprang to the
      window, where she could look down upon the carriage standing before the
      house; it was open, and in it sat two ladies, one middle-aged, the other
      much younger. To her vexation she could not, from this distance, clearly
      discern their faces; but on glancing rapidly round the room, she saw
      Horace&rsquo;s little binocular. An instant brought it into focus upon the
      carriage, and what she then saw gave Mrs. Damerel such a shock, that an
      exclamation escaped her. Still she gazed through the glasses, and only
      turned away when the vehicle drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace came up flushed and panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right. They wanted me to go for a drive, but I explained&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the binocular in Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s hand, and at the same moment read
      detection on her countenance. She gazed at him; he answered the look with
      lowering challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace, that was Fanny French.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it was, aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is going on between you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took a seat on the edge of the table, and swung his leg. He
      looked suddenly obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We met by accident&mdash;here&mdash;the other day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I believe that, Horace?&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel, in a voice of soft
      reproach. And she drew near to him. &lsquo;Be truthful with me, dear. Do tell me
      the truth!&mdash;Is she anything to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told you the truth, aunt. She came here, as I have done, for her
      health. I haven&rsquo;t seen her for two years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t wish to renew acquaintance with her,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you
      don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked away, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, do you know her character?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was startling, but Mrs. Damerel kept firm, though agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has led the most disgraceful life. I heard about her half a year
      after she ran away, but of course I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you such painful
      things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace reddened with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who is to blame for it?&rsquo; he cried passionately. &lsquo;Who drove her to
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t come back to that again, Horace!&rsquo; pleaded the other.
      &lsquo;How can any one drive a girl into a life of scandalous immorality? It was
      in herself, dear. She took to it naturally, as so many women do. Remember
      that letter she wrote from Brussels, which I sent you a copy of&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a forgery!&rsquo; thundered Horace. &lsquo;I have asked her. She says she
      never wrote any such letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she lies, as such creatures always do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitterness of apprehension overcame Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s prudence. With flashing
      eyes, she faced the young man and dared his wrath. As they stood thus, the
      two were astonishingly like each other, from forehead to chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use, I&rsquo;m not going to quarrel with you, aunt. Think what you like
      of Miss. French, <i>I</i> know the truth about her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped from the table, and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will say no more, Horace. You are independent, and must have your own
      acquaintances. But after you are married&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other voice interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had better tell you at once. I shall not marry Miss. Chittle. I am
      going to write this afternoon to break it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel went pale, and stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace, you can&rsquo;t be so wicked as that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; he pursued recklessly, &lsquo;to break it off now, than to marry
      her and make her miserable. I don&rsquo;t love her, and I have never really
      thought I did. I was going to marry her only for her money. Why she wants
      to marry me, I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s something wrong; she doesn&rsquo;t really
      care for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She does! I assure you she does!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel went close to him, and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo;&mdash;her voice was so low that it seemed terror-stricken,&mdash;&lsquo;you
      don&rsquo;t mean to marry&mdash;any one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew apart, she followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that would be terrible! What can I say to open your eyes and show you
      what you are doing? Horace, have you no sense of honour? Can you find it
      in your heart to cast off a girl who loves you, and thinks that in so
      short a time she will be your wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This again is your fault,&rsquo; he replied, with a violence which proved the
      conflict of emotions in him. &lsquo;But for you, I should never have proposed to
      Winifred&mdash;never dreamt of such a thing. What do I want with her
      money? I have enough of my own, and I shall make more in business. Why
      have you driven me into this? Did you expect to get some profit out of
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow struck home, and Mrs. Damerel flinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had your happiness in view, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My happiness! that&rsquo;s your view of things; that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t really
      like you, from the first. You think of nothing but money. Why you objected
      to Fanny French at first was because you wished me to marry some one
      richer. I don&rsquo;t thank you for that kind of happiness; I had rather marry a
      woman I can love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you can love such a creature as that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she lost her self-command; the mere thought of Fanny&rsquo;s possible
      triumph exasperated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t hear her abused,&rsquo; cried Horace, with answering passion. &lsquo;You are
      the last person who ought to do it. Comparing her and you, I can&rsquo;t help
      saying&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of pain checked his random words; he looked at Mrs.
      Damerel, and saw her features wrung with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t speak to me like that!&rsquo; Once more she approached him. &lsquo;If you
      only knew&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always been a worldly woman,
      but you are breaking my heart, Horace! My dear, my dear, if only out of
      pity for me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I pity you?&rsquo; he cried impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because&mdash;Horace&mdash;give me your hand, dear; let me tell you
      something.&mdash;I am your mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed and choked, clinging to his arm, resting her forehead against
      it. The young man, stricken with amazement, stared at her, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am your own mother, dear,&rsquo; she went on, in a quivering voice. &lsquo;Your
      mother and Nancy&rsquo;s. And neither of you can love me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be?&rsquo; Horace asked, with genuine perplexity. &lsquo;How could you
      have married some one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed an arm about his neck, and hid her face against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I left your father&mdash;and he made me free to marry again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were divorced?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace did not mean to speak brutally; in his wonderment he merely pressed
      for a complete explanation. The answer was a sob, and for some moments
      neither of them spoke. Then the mother, her face still hidden, went on in
      a thick voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I married because I was poor&mdash;for no other reason&mdash;and then
      came the temptation. I behaved wickedly, I deserted my little children.
      Don&rsquo;t revenge yourself upon me now, darling! If only I could have told you
      this before&mdash;I did so want to, but I was afraid. I had to conceal
      half my love for you. You can&rsquo;t imagine how I have suffered from your
      anger, and from Nancy&rsquo;s coldness. You don&rsquo;t know me; I have never been
      able to let you see what I really think and feel. I am worldly; I can&rsquo;t
      live without luxuries and society and amusements; but I love you, my dear
      son, and it will break my heart if you ruin yourself. It&rsquo;s true I thought
      of Winifred&rsquo;s money, but she is very fond of you, Horace; her mother has
      told me she is. And it was because of my own position. I have spent nearly
      all my husband left me; it wasn&rsquo;t enough to supply me with an income; I
      could only hope that something&mdash;that you, dear, would forgive your
      poor mother, and help her. If you cast me off, what shall I do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Then the young man spoke gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are welcome, mother, to half my income. But you must leave me free to
      marry as I like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I can&rsquo;t take a penny from you,&rsquo; she answered, weeping. &lsquo;If you ruin
      yourself, you ruin me as well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ruin would come if I married Winifred. I love Fanny; I love her with
      all my heart and soul, and have never ceased to love her. Tell me what you
      like about her, it will make no difference.&rsquo;

      A fit of violent coughing stopped his speech; he turned away, and stood by
      the window, holding his handkerchief to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel sank upon a chair in mute misery.

      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Below the hill at Harrow, in a byway which has no charm but that of
      quietness, stands a row of small plain houses, built not long ago, yet at
      a time when small houses were constructed with some regard for soundness
      and durability. Each contains six rooms, has a little strip of garden in
      the rear, and is, or was in 1889, let at a rent of six-and-twenty pounds.
      The house at the far end of the row (as the inhabitants described it) was
      then tenanted by Mary Woodruff, and with her, as a lodger, lived Mrs.
      Tarrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a lodger, seeing that she paid a specified weekly sum for her shelter
      and maintenance; in no other respect could the wretched title apply to
      her. To occupy furnished lodgings, is to live in a house owned and ruled
      by servants; the least tolerable status known to civilisation. From her
      long experience at Falmouth, Nancy knew enough of the petty miseries
      attendant upon that condition to think of it with dread when the stress of
      heroic crisis compelled her speedy departure from the old home. It is
      seldom that heroic crisis bears the precise consequence presumed by the
      actors in it; supreme moments are wont to result in some form of
      compromise. So Nancy, prepared to go forth into the wilderness of
      landladies, babe in arm, found that so dreary a self-sacrifice neither was
      exacted of her, nor would indeed be permitted; she had to reckon with Mary
      Woodruff. Mary, thanks to her old master, enjoyed an income more than
      sufficient to her needs; if Nancy must needs go into lodgings,&mdash;inevitable,
      perhaps, as matters stood,&mdash;her friend was ready with kind and
      practical suggestion; to wit, that she should take and furnish a house for
      herself, and place a portion of it at Mrs. Tarrant&rsquo;s disposal. To this
      even Tarrant could offer no objection; he stipulated only that his wife
      should find a temporary refuge from the home she had occupied on false
      pretences until Mary had her new house in readiness. This was managed
      without difficulty. Nancy went to Dulwich, and for several weeks dwelt
      with the honest woman who took care of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the dealings between Nancy and her legal guardians Tarrant learned
      nothing, save the bare fact that her marriage was avowed, and all benefit
      under her father&rsquo;s will renounced. He did not visit the house at Dulwich,
      and only saw his child after the removal to Harrow. On this occasion he
      asked Nancy what arrangements had been made concerning the money that must
      be reimbursed to the Messrs Barmby; she replied that justice would be
      done, but the affair was hers alone, and to her must be left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant himself suggested the neighbourhood of Harrow for Nancy&rsquo;s abode.
      It united the conditions of being remote from Camberwell, of lying beyond
      the great smoke-area, and of permitting him, poor as he was, to visit his
      wife whenever he thought fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December, Nancy had lived thus for all but a twelvemonth, seeing the
      while none of her old acquaintances, and with very little news from her
      old world. What she heard came through Horace, who, after learning with
      astonishment the secret in his sister&rsquo;s life, came by degrees to something
      like the old terms of affection with her, and went over to Harrow pretty
      frequently. Of his engagement to Winifred Chittle he at once informed
      Nancy, who tried to be glad of it, but could have little faith in anything
      traceable to the influence of Mrs. Damerel. With that lady the Harrow
      household had no direct communication; Tarrant had written to her on the
      night of crisis, civilly requesting her to keep aloof, as her advice and
      assistance were in nowise needed. She answered him with good temper, and
      wrote kindly to Nancy; after that, silence on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wanted a few days to Christmas; with nightfall had come a roaring wind
      and sleety rain; the house-door was locked; within, lamps and fires burned
      cheerily. At half-past six, Nancy&mdash;she occupied the two front rooms&mdash;sat
      in her parlour, resting after the exertion of putting her son to bed. To
      judge from her countenance, she was well and happy. The furniture about
      her aimed at nothing but homely comfort; the pictures and books, being
      beyond dispute her own, had come from Grove Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save when Tarrant was here, Nancy and Mary of course lived like friends
      who share a house, eating together and generally sitting together. During
      an hour or two each day the younger woman desired solitude, for a reason
      understood by her companion, who then looked after the baby. This present
      evening Nancy had proposed to spend alone; but, after sitting idly for a
      few minutes, she opened the door and called Mary&mdash;just then occupied
      in teaching a young servant how to iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not write, after all,&rsquo; she said, when her friend came. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m too
      tired. Bring your sewing, or your book, here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was never talkative; Nancy kept a longer silence than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How,&rsquo; she exclaimed at length, &lsquo;do poor women with a lot of children
      manage? It really is a mystery to me. Here am I with one baby, and with
      the constant help of two people; yet he tires me out. Not a troublesome
      baby, either; healthy and good-tempered. Yet the thought and anxiety and
      downright hard labour for a good twelve hours out of the twenty-four! I
      feel that a second child would be too much for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, but looked seriously for the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor mothers,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;can&rsquo;t give the same care to their children
      that you give to baby. The little ones grow up, or they don&rsquo;t grow up&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what it comes to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; that is to say, only the fit survive. A very good thing&mdash;when
      other people&rsquo;s children are in question. But I should kill myself in
      taking care of them, if I had a large family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have known mothers who did,&rsquo; Mary remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It comes to this. Nature doesn&rsquo;t intend a married woman to be anything <i>but</i>
      a married woman. In the natural state of things, she must either be the
      slave of husband and children, or defy her duty. She can have no time to
      herself, no thoughts for herself. It&rsquo;s a hard saying, but who can doubt
      that it is Nature&rsquo;s law? I should like to revolt against it, yet I feel
      revolt to be silly. One might as well revolt against being born a woman
      instead of a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary reflected, but held her peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then comes in money,&rsquo; pursued Nancy, &lsquo;and that alters the state of the
      case at once. The wife with money says to people: Come here, and be my
      slaves. Toil for me, whilst I am enjoying myself in ways that Dame Nature
      wouldn&rsquo;t allow. I want to read, to play music, to see my friends, to see
      the world. Unless you will slave for me, I can&rsquo;t budge from nursery and
      kitchen.&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it a queer thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The less sophisticated woman had a difficulty in catching Nancy&rsquo;s point of
      view. She began to argue that domestic service was no slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it <i>comes</i> to that,&rsquo; Nancy insisted. &lsquo;And what I mean is, that
      the thought has made me far more contented than I was at first. After all,
      one can put up with a great deal, if you feel you&rsquo;re obeying a law of
      Nature. Now, I have brains, and I should like to use them; but Nature says
      that&rsquo;s not so important as bringing up the little child to whom I have
      given life. One thought that troubles me is, that every generation of
      women is sacrificed to the generation that follows; and of course that&rsquo;s
      why women are so inferior to men. But then again, Nature says that women
      are born <i>only</i> to be sacrificed. I always come round to that. I
      don&rsquo;t like it, but I am bound to believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Children grow up,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;and then mothers are free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Free to do what? To think of what they <i>might</i> have done in the best
      years of their life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not said discontentedly; Nancy&rsquo;s mood seemed to be singularly calm
      and philosophical. She propped her chin on her hand, and gazed at the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; remarked Mary, with a smile, &lsquo;you, at all events, are not one of
      the poorest women. All seems to be going well, and you will be able, I am
      sure, to get all the help you need.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps. But I shall never feel quiet in my conscience. I shall feel as
      if I had defeated Nature by a trick, and fear that she&rsquo;ll somehow be
      revenged on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite beyond Mary&rsquo;s scope of thought, and she frankly said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing I&rsquo;m quite sure of, Nancy,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;and that is, that
      education makes life very much harder to live. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t hold
      with educating the poor&mdash;not beyond reading and writing. Without
      education, life is very plain, though it may be a struggle. But from what
      I have seen of highly-taught people, I&rsquo;m very sure they suffer worse in
      their minds than the poor ever do in their bodies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Was that baby?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only the wind, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content, Nancy went to the foot of the stairs. Whilst she stood there
      listening, Mary came out, and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tap at the window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&mdash;You must have been mistaken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was a tap on the glass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew to the back sitting-room, and Nancy, with quick step, went to
      open the house-door. A great gust of wind forced it against her as soon as
      she turned the handle; standing firm, she peeped into darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any one there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No enemy but winter and rough weather,&rsquo; chanted a familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what brings you here, frightening lone women at this time of night?
      Shut and lock the door for me. The house will be blown out of the
      windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy retreated to her parlour, and stood there in an attitude of joyous
      expectation. Without hurry Tarrant hung up his coat and hat in the
      passage, then came forward, wiping rain from his moustache. Their eyes met
      in a smile, frank and confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why have you come, Lionel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No reason in particular. The fancy took me. Am I unwelcome?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, his wife&rsquo;s arms were thrown about him. A lovers&rsquo; meeting, with
      more of tenderness, and scarcely less of warmth, than when Nancy knocked
      at the door in Staple Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you hungry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only for what you have given me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some tea, then, after that wretched journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. How&rsquo;s the boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her upon his knee, and listened laughingly whilst the newest
      marvels of babyhood were laughingly related.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything from Horace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word. He must be in London now; I shall write tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant nodded carelessly. He had the smallest interest in his wife&rsquo;s
      brother, but could not help satisfaction in the thought that Horace was to
      be reputably, and even brilliantly, married. From all he knew of Horace,
      the probability had seemed that his marriage would be some culmination of
      folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you have something to tell me,&rsquo; Nancy said presently, when her
      hand had been fondled for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing much, but good as far as it goes. Bunbury has asked me to write
      him an article every week for the first six months of &lsquo;90. Column and a
      half, at two guineas a column.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three guineas a week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O rare head!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So there&rsquo;s no anxiety for the first half of next year, at all events,&rsquo; 
      said Nancy, with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I can count on a margin of fifty pounds or so by midsummer&mdash;towards
      the debt, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy bit her lip in vexation, but neither made nor wished to make any
      protest. Only a week or two ago, since entering upon his patrimony, Horace
      Lord had advanced the sum necessary to repay what Nancy owed to the
      Barmbys. However rich Horace was going to be, this debt to him must be
      cancelled. On that, as on most other points, Tarrant and his wife held a
      firm agreement of opinion. Yet they wanted money; the past year had been a
      time of struggle to make ends meet. Neither was naturally disposed to
      asceticism, and if they did not grumble it was only because grumbling
      would have been undignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you dine with the great people on Thursday?&rsquo; Nancy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and rather enjoyed it. There were one or two clever women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been anywhere else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An hour at a smoking-concert the other evening. Pippit, the actor, was
      there, and recited a piece much better than I ever heard him speak
      anything on the stage. They told me he was drunk; very possibly that
      accounted for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To a number of such details Nancy listened quietly, with bent head. She
      had learned to put absolute faith in all that Tarrant told her of his
      quasi-bachelor life; she suspected no concealment; but the monotony of her
      own days lay heavy upon her whilst he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you smoke?&rsquo; she asked, rising from his knee to fetch the pipe and
      tobacco-jar kept for him upon a shelf. Slippers also she brought him, and
      would have unlaced his muddy boots had Tarrant permitted it. When he
      presented a picture of masculine comfort, Nancy, sitting opposite,
      cautiously approached a subject of which as yet there had been no word
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t you to get more comfortable lodgings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I do very well. I&rsquo;m accustomed to the place, and I like the
      situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kept his room in Great College Street, though often obliged to
      scant his meals as the weekly rent-day approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might make some better&mdash;some more economical
      arrangement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy took courage, and spoke her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more expensive to live separately than if we were together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant seemed to give the point his impartial consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;no, I think not. Certainly not, with our present arrangements.
      And even if it were we pay for your comfort, and my liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have as much liberty if we were living under the same roof?
      Of course I know that you couldn&rsquo;t live out here; it would put a stop to
      your work at once. But suppose we moved. Mary might take a rather larger
      house&mdash;it needn&rsquo;t be much larger&mdash;in a part convenient for you.
      We should be able to pay her enough to set off against her increased
      expenses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Smoking calmly, Tarrant shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impracticable. Do you mean that this place is too dull for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t lively, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the place. If <i>you</i> lived
      here, it would be all I should wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That sounds so prettily from your lips, Nancy, that I&rsquo;m half ashamed to
      contradict it. But the truth is that you can only say such things because
      we live apart. Don&rsquo;t deceive yourself. With a little more money, this life
      of ours would be as nearly perfect as married life ever can be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy remembered a previous occasion when he spoke to the same purpose.
      But it was in the time she did not like to think of, and in spite of
      herself the recollection troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have more variety,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;Next year you shall come into
      town much oftener&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of that. I always like going anywhere with you; but I
      have plenty of occupations and pleasures at home.&mdash;I think we ought
      to be under the same roof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ought? Because Mrs. Tomkins would cry <i>haro</i>! if her husband the
      greengrocer wasn&rsquo;t at her elbow day and night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have more patience with me. I didn&rsquo;t mean <i>ought</i> in the vulgar
      sense&mdash;I have as little respect for Mrs. Tomkins as you have. I don&rsquo;t
      want to interfere with your liberty for a moment; indeed it would be very
      foolish, for I know that it would make you detest me. But I so often want
      to speak to you&mdash;and&mdash;and then, I can&rsquo;t quite feel that you
      acknowledge me as your wife so long as I am away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I quite understand. The social difficulty. Well, there&rsquo;s no doubt it is a
      difficulty; I feel it on your account. I wish it were possible for you to
      be invited wherever I am. Some day it will be, if I don&rsquo;t get run over in
      the Strand; but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like the invitations,&rsquo; Nancy broke in, &lsquo;but you still don&rsquo;t
      understand me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think I do. You are a woman, and it&rsquo;s quite impossible for a woman
      to see this matter as a man does. Nancy, there is not one wife in fifty
      thousand who retains her husband&rsquo;s love after the first year of marriage.
      Put aside the fools and the worthless; think only of women with whom you
      might be compared&mdash;brave, sensible, pure-hearted; they can win love,
      but don&rsquo;t know how to keep it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not put it the other way about, and say that men can love to begin
      with, but so soon grow careless?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I am myself an instance to the contrary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy smiled, but was not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The only married people,&rsquo; Tarrant pursued, &lsquo;who can live together with
      impunity, are those who are rich enough, and sensible enough, to have two
      distinct establishments under the same roof. The ordinary eight or
      ten-roomed house, inhabited by decent middle-class folk, is a gruesome
      sight. What a huddlement of male and female! They are factories of quarrel
      and hate&mdash;those respectable, brass-curtain-rodded sties&mdash;they
      are full of things that won&rsquo;t bear mentioning. If our income never rises
      above that, we shall live to the end of our days as we do now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can you hope to make thousands a year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no such hope; hundreds would be sufficient. I don&rsquo;t aim at a house
      in London; everything there is intolerable, except the fine old houses
      which have a history, and which I could never afford. For my home, I want
      to find some rambling old place among hills and woods,&mdash;some house
      where generations have lived and died,&mdash;where my boy, as he grows up,
      may learn to love the old and beautiful things about him. I myself never
      had a home; most London children don&rsquo;t know what is meant by home; their
      houses are only more or less comfortable lodgings, perpetual change within
      and without.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your thoughts are wonderfully like my father&rsquo;s, sometimes,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From what you have told me of him, I think we should have agreed in a
      good many things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how unfortunate we were! If he had recovered from that illness,&mdash;if
      he had lived only a few months,&mdash;everything would have been made
      easy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me altogether too easy,&rsquo; Tarrant observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been a good thing for you to have to work,&rsquo; Nancy assented. &lsquo;I
      understand the change for the better in you. But&rsquo;&mdash;she smiled&mdash;&lsquo;you
      have more self-will than you used to have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just where I have gained.&mdash;But don&rsquo;t think that I find it
      easy or pleasant to resist your wish. I couldn&rsquo;t do it if I were not so
      sure that I am acting for your advantage as well as my own. A man who
      finds himself married to a fool, is a fool himself if he doesn&rsquo;t take his
      own course regardless of his wife. But I am in a very different position;
      I love you more and more, Nancy, because I am learning more and more to
      respect you; I think of your happiness most assuredly as much as I think
      of my own. But even if my own good weighed as nothing against yours, I
      should be wise to resist you just as I do now. Hugger-mugger marriage is a
      defilement and a curse. We know it from the experience of the world at
      large,&mdash;which is perhaps more brutalised by marriage than by anything
      else.&mdash;No need to test the thing once more, to our own disaster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I think is, that, though you pay me compliments, you really have a
      very poor opinion of me. You think I should burden and worry you in
      endless silly ways. I am not such a simpleton. In however small a house,
      there could be your rooms and mine. Do you suppose I should interfere with
      your freedom in coming and going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether you meant to or not, you would&mdash;so long as we are struggling
      with poverty. However self-willed I am, I am not selfish; and to see you
      living a monotonous, imprisoned life would be a serious hindrance to me in
      my own living and working. Of course the fact is so at present, and I
      often enough think in a troubled way about you; but you are out of my
      sight, and that enables me to keep you out of mind. If I am away from home
      till one or two in the morning, there is no lonely wife fretting and
      wondering about me. For work such as mine, I must live as though I were
      not married at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose we got out of our poverty,&rsquo; urged Nancy, &lsquo;you would be living
      the same life, I suppose; and how would it be any better for you or me
      that we had a large house instead of a small one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your position will be totally changed. When money comes, friends come.
      You are not hiding away from Society because you are unfit for it, only
      because you can&rsquo;t live as your social equals do. When you have friends of
      your own, social engagements, interests on every hand, I shall be able to
      go my own way without a pang of conscience. When we come together, it will
      be to talk of your affairs as well as of mine. Living as you do now, you
      have nothing on earth but the baby to think about&mdash;a miserable state
      of things for a woman with a mind. I know it is miserable, and I&rsquo;m
      struggling tooth and nail to help you out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then there are years of it still before me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven forbid! Some years, no doubt, before we shall have a home; but not
      before I can bring you in contact with the kind of people you ought to
      know. You shall have a decent house&mdash;socially possible&mdash;somewhere
      out west; and I, of course, shall still go on in lodgings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for Nancy&rsquo;s reply, but she kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are still dissatisfied?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, and commanded her features to the expression which makes
      whatever woman lovely&mdash;that of rational acquiescence. On the faces of
      most women such look is never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am content. You are working hard, and I won&rsquo;t make it harder for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak always like that!&rsquo; Tarrant&rsquo;s face was radiant. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of
      thing that binds man to woman, body and soul. With the memory of that look
      and speech, would it be possible for me to slight you in my life apart? It
      makes you my friend; and the word friend is better to my ear than wife. A
      man&rsquo;s wife is more often than not his enemy. Harvey Munden was telling me
      of a poor devil of an author who daren&rsquo;t be out after ten at night because
      of the fool-fury waiting for him at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose she can&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And suppose she can&rsquo;t? What is the value of nominal fidelity, secured by
      mutual degradation such as that? A rational woman would infinitely rather
      have a husband who was often unfaithful to her than keep him faithful by
      such means. Husband and wife should interfere with each other not a jot
      more than two friends of the same sex living together. If a man, under
      such circumstances, worried his friend&rsquo;s life out by petty prying, he
      would get his head punched. A wife has no more justification in worrying
      her husband with jealousies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How if it were the wife that excited suspicion?&rsquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Infidelity in a woman is much worse than in a man. If a man really
      suspects his wife, he must leave her, that&rsquo;s all; then let her justify
      herself if she can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy cared little to discuss this point. In argument with any one else,
      she would doubtless have maintained the equality of man and woman before
      the moral law; but that would only have been in order to prove herself
      modern-spirited. Tarrant&rsquo;s dictum did not revolt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends are equals,&rsquo; she said, after a little thought. &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t
      think me your equal, and you won&rsquo;t be satisfied with me unless I follow
      your guidance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant laughed kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, I am your superior in force of mind and force of body. Don&rsquo;t you
      like to hear that? Doesn&rsquo;t it do you good&mdash;when you think of the
      maudlin humbug generally talked by men to women? We can&rsquo;t afford to
      disguise that truth. All the same, we are friends, because each has the
      other&rsquo;s interest at heart, and each would be ashamed to doubt the other&rsquo;s
      loyalty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the evening they spent with Mary, in whom Tarrant
      always found something new to admire. He regarded her as the most
      wonderful phenomenon in nature&mdash;an uneducated woman who was neither
      vulgar nor foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby slept in a cot beside Nancy&rsquo;s bed. For fear of waking him, the wedded
      lovers entered their room very softly, with a shaded candle. Tarrant
      looked at the curly little head, the little clenched hand, and gave a
      silent laugh of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the breakfast-table next morning lay a letter from Horace. As soon as
      she had opened it, Nancy uttered an exclamation which prepared her
      companion for ill news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I expected&mdash;though I tried not to think so. &ldquo;I write aline
      only to tell you that my marriage is broken off. You will know the
      explanation before long. Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about it. I should never
      have been happy with Winifred, nor she with me. We may not see each other
      for some time, but I will write again soon.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t say whether he or
      she broke it off. I hope it was Winifred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rsquo; said Tarrant, &lsquo;from the tone of that letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, too. It means something wretched. He writes from his
      London lodgings. Lionel, let me go back with you, and see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gravest fear Nancy would not communicate. And it hit the truth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      They parted at Baker Street, Tarrant for his lodgings and the work that
      awaited him there, Nancy to go westward by another train.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the house from which her brother had dated his letter, it
      was half-past ten. At the door stood a cab, and a servant was helping the
      driver to hoist a big trunk on to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Lord still here?&rsquo; Nancy asked of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s just this minute a-goin&rsquo;, miss. This is his luggage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent her name, and was quickly led up to the first floor. There stood
      Horace, ready for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why have you come?&rsquo; he asked, with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What else could I do on hearing such news?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you I should write again, and I said plainly that it was better we
      shouldn&rsquo;t see each other for some time.&mdash;Why will people pester me
      out of my life?&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a child to be hunted like this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant, he had fallen into a state of excitement which alarmed his
      sister. There were drops of sweat on his forehead, and tears in his eyes;
      the blood had rushed to his cheeks, and he trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so troubled about you,&rsquo; said Nancy, with anxious tenderness. &lsquo;I have
      been looking forward with such hope to your marriage,&mdash;and now&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you anything about it just now. It was all Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s
      doing; the engagement, I mean. It&rsquo;s a good thing I drew back in time.&mdash;But
      I have a train to catch; I really mustn&rsquo;t stay talking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going far, Horace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Bournemouth again,&mdash;for the present. I&rsquo;ve given up these rooms,
      and I&rsquo;m taking all my things away. In a month or two I may go abroad; but
      I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Already he was out of the room; his sister had no choice but to follow him
      downstairs. He looked so ill, and behaved with such lack of
      self-restraint, that Nancy kept her eyes upon him in an awestricken gaze,
      as though watching some one on the headlong way to destruction. Pouring
      rain obliged her to put up her umbrella as she stepped down on to the
      pavement. Horace, having shouted a direction to the driver, entered the
      cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t even shaken hands with me, Horace,&rsquo; Nancy exclaimed, standing
      at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, dear; good-bye! You shouldn&rsquo;t have come in weather such as
      this. Get home as fast as you can. Good-bye!&mdash;Tell the fellow to
      drive sharp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the cab clattered away, sending spurts of mud on to Nancy&rsquo;s
      waterproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on for a few paces without reflection, until the vehicle
      disappeared round a corner. Coming to herself, she made for the railway
      again, which was at only a few minutes&rsquo; distance, and there she sat down
      by the fire in the waiting-room. Her health for the last year had been
      sound as in the days of girlhood; it was rarely that she caught cold, and
      weather would have been indifferent to her but for the discomfort which
      hindered her free movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vexed at so futile a journey, she resolved not to return home without
      making another effort to learn something about Horace. The only person to
      whom she could apply was the one who would certainly be possessed of
      information,&mdash;Mrs. Damerel. At the time of Horace&rsquo;s engagement, Nancy
      had heard from Mrs. Damerel, and replied to the letter; she remembered her
      aunt&rsquo;s address, and as the distance was not great, the temptation to go
      there now proved irresistible. Her husband would dislike to hear of such a
      step, but he had never forbidden communication with Mrs. Damerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      By help of train and omnibus she reached her new destination in
      half-an-hour, and felt a relief on learning that Mrs. Damerel was at home.
      But it surprised her to be conducted into a room where lamps were burning,
      and blinds drawn close; she passed suddenly from cheerless day to cosy
      evening. Mrs. Damerel, negligently attired, received her with a show of
      warm welcome, but appeared nervous and out of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not very well,&rsquo; she admitted, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s why I have shut out the
      dreadful weather. Isn&rsquo;t it the most sensible way of getting through the
      worst of a London winter? To pretend that there is daylight is quite
      ridiculous, so one may as well have the comforts of night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to speak about Horace,&rsquo; said Nancy, at once. In any case, she
      would have felt embarrassment, and it was increased by the look with which
      Mrs. Damerel kept regarding her,&mdash;a look of confusion, of shrinking,
      of intense and painful scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what has happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had a letter from him this morning, to say that his marriage was broken
      off&mdash;nothing else. So I came over from Harrow to see him. But he had
      hardly a minute to speak to me. He was just starting for Bournemouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what did he tell you?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Damerel, who remained standing,&mdash;or
      rather had risen, after a pretence of seating herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all. He was very strange in his manner. He said he would
      write.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that he is seriously ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid he must be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has grown much worse during the last fortnight. Don&rsquo;t you suspect any
      reason for his throwing off poor Winifred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wondered whether he had met that girl again. But it seemed very
      unlikely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has. She was at Bournemouth for her health. She, too, is ill;
      consumptive, like poor Horace,&mdash;of course a result of the life she
      has been leading. And he is going to marry her.&lsquo;Nancy&rsquo;s heart sank. She
      could say nothing. She remembered Horace&rsquo;s face, and saw in him the victim
      of ruthless destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done my utmost. He didn&rsquo;t speak of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to say that his engagement with Winifred was brought about by you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wasn&rsquo;t I justified? If the poor boy must die, he would at least have
      died with friends about him, and in peace. I always feared just what has
      happened. It&rsquo;s only a few months ago that he forgave me for being, as he
      thought, the cause of that girl&rsquo;s ruin; and since then I have hardly dared
      to lose sight of him. I went down to Bournemouth unexpectedly, and was
      with him when that creature came to the door in a carriage. You haven&rsquo;t
      seen her. She looks what she is, the vilest of the vile. As if any one can
      be held responsible for that! She was born to be what she is. And if I had
      the power, I would crush out her hateful life to save poor Horace!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, though at one with the speaker in her hatred of Fanny French, found
      it as difficult as ever to feel sympathetically towards Mrs. Damerel. She
      could not credit this worldly woman with genuine affection for Horace; the
      vehemence of her speech surprised and troubled her, she knew not how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said nothing more about me?&rsquo; added Mrs. Damerel, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Nancy that she heard a sigh of relief. The other&rsquo;s face was
      turned away. Then Mrs. Damerel took a seat by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will be married to-morrow, I dare say, at Bournemouth&mdash;no use
      trying to prevent it. I don&rsquo;t know whether you will believe me, but it is
      a blow that will darken the rest of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sounded slightly hoarse, and she lay back in the chair, with
      drooping head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have nothing to reproach yourself with,&rsquo; said Nancy, yielding to a
      vague and troublous pity. &lsquo;And you have done as much as any one could on
      his behalf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never see him again&mdash;that&rsquo;s the hardest thought. She will
      poison him against me. He told me I had lied to him about a letter that
      girl wrote from Brussels; she has made him think her a spotless innocent,
      and he hates me for the truth I told about her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However short his life,&rsquo; said Nancy, &lsquo;he is only too likely to find out
      what she really is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sure of that. She knows he is doomed, and it&rsquo;s her interest to
      play a part. He will die thinking the worst of me.&mdash;Nancy, if he
      writes to you, and says anything against me, you will remember what it
      means?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My opinion of people is not affected by hearsay,&rsquo; Nancy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a remark of dubious significance, and Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s averted eyes
      seemed to show that she derived little satisfaction from it. As the
      silence was unbroken, Nancy rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will soon get rid of your cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, my dear. I haven&rsquo;t asked how the little boy is. Well, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, I am glad to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your husband&mdash;he is prospering?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say he is prospering; it seems to mean so much; but I
      think he is doing good work, and we are satisfied with the results.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, you are an admirable wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy coloured; for the first time, a remark of Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s had given
      her pleasure. She moved forward with hand offered for leave-taking. They
      had never kissed each other, but, as if overcoming diffidence, Mrs.
      Damerel advanced her lips; then, as suddenly, she drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had forgotten. I may give you my sore throat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy kissed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mrs. Damerel was feverish, and the next day she kept her bed.
      The servant who waited upon her had to endure a good many sharp reproofs;
      trouble did not sweeten this lady&rsquo;s temper, yet she never lost sight of
      self-respect, and even proved herself capable of acknowledging that she
      was in the wrong. Mrs. Damerel possessed the elements of civilisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This illness tried her patience in no slight degree. Something she had
      wished to do, something of high moment, was vexatiously postponed. A whole
      week went by before she could safely leave the house, and even then her
      mirror counselled a new delay. But on the third day of the new year she
      made a careful toilette, and sent for a cab,&mdash;the brougham she had
      been wont to hire being now beyond her means.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove to Farringdon Street, and climbed to the office of Mr Luckworth
      Crewe. Her knowledge of Crewe&rsquo;s habits enabled her to choose the fitting
      hour for this call; he had lunched, and was smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How delightful to see you here!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;But why did you trouble
      to come? If you had written, or telegraphed, I would have saved you the
      journey. I haven&rsquo;t even a chair that&rsquo;s fit for you to sit down on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense! It&rsquo;s a most comfortable little room. Haven&rsquo;t you improved
      it since I called?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have to look out for a bigger place. I&rsquo;m outgrowing this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you really? That&rsquo;s excellent news. Ah, but what sad things have been
      happening!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business,&rsquo; Crewe answered, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I should have heard from you about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason of his silence she perfectly understood. Since Horace&rsquo;s
      engagement, there had been a marked change in her demeanour towards the
      man of business; she had answered his one or two letters with such cold
      formality, and, on the one occasion of his venturing to call, had received
      him with so marked a reserve, that Crewe, as he expressed it to himself,
      &lsquo;got his back up.&rsquo; His ideas of chivalrous devotion were anything but
      complex; he could not bend before a divinity who snubbed him; if the once
      gracious lady chose to avert her countenance, he would let her know that
      it didn&rsquo;t matter much to him after all. Moreover, Mrs. Damerel&rsquo;s behaviour
      was too suggestive; he could hardly be wrong in explaining it by the fact
      that her nephew, about to be enriched by marriage, might henceforth be
      depended upon for all the assistance she needed. This, in the Americanism
      which came naturally to Crewe&rsquo;s lips, was &lsquo;playing it rather low down,&rsquo; 
      and he resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden ruin of Horace Lord&rsquo;s prospects (he had learnt the course of
      events from Horace himself) amused and gratified him. How would the high
      and mighty Mrs. Damerel relish this catastrophe? Would she have the
      &lsquo;cheek&rsquo; to return to her old graciousness? If so, he had the game in his
      hands; she should see that he was not to be made a fool of a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the mere announcement of her name sufficed to shatter his resolve. Her
      smile, her soft accents, her polished manners, laid the old spell upon
      him. He sought to excuse himself for having forsaken her in her trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really floored me. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say or do. I was afraid you
      might think I was meddling with what didn&rsquo;t concern me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how could I have thought that? It has made me ill; I have suffered
      more than I can tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look quite the thing,&rsquo; said Crewe, searching her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so. He is married, and that&rsquo;s the end of it, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Damerel winced at this blunt announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When was it?&rsquo; she asked, in an undertone. &lsquo;I only knew he had made up his
      mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe mentioned the date; the day after Nancy&rsquo;s call upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are they at Bournemouth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Will be for a month or so, he says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t talk of it. As you say, that&rsquo;s the end. Nothing worse
      could have happened. Has he been speaking of me again like he used to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard him mention your name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She heaved a sigh, and began to look round the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us try to forget, and talk of pleasanter things. It seems such a long
      time since you told me anything about your business. You remember how we
      used to gossip. I suppose I have been so absorbed in that poor boy&rsquo;s
      affairs; it made me selfish&mdash;I was so overjoyed, I really could think
      of nothing else. And now&mdash;! But I must and will drive it out of my
      mind. I have been moping at home, day after day, in wretched solitude. I
      wanted to write to you, but I hadn&rsquo;t the heart&mdash;scarcely the
      strength. I kept hoping you might call&mdash;if only to ask how I was. Of
      course everything had to be explained to inquisitive people&mdash;how I
      hate them all! It&rsquo;s the nature of the world to mock at misfortunes such as
      this. It would really have done me good to speak for a few minutes with
      such a friend as you&mdash;a real friend. I am going to live a quiet,
      retired life. I am sick of the world, its falsity, and its malice, and its
      bitter, bitter disappointments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe&rsquo;s native wit and rich store of experience availed him nothing when
      Mrs. Damerel discoursed thus. The silvery accents flattered his ear, and
      crept into the soft places of his nature. He felt as when a clever actress
      in a pathetic part wrought upon him in the after-dinner mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must bear up against it, Mrs. Damerel. And I don&rsquo;t think a retired
      life would suit you at all. You are made for Society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t seek for compliments. I am speaking quite sincerely. Ah, those were
      happy days that I spent at Whitsand! Tell me what you have been doing. Is
      there any hope of the pier yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s as good as built!&rsquo; cried the other. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see the
      advertisements, when we floated the company a month ago? I suppose you
      don&rsquo;t read that kind of thing. We shall begin at the works in early
      spring.&mdash;Look here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He unrolled a large design, a coloured picture of Whitsand pier as it
      already existed in his imagination. Not content with having the mere
      structure exhibited, Crewe had persuaded the draughtsman to add
      embellishments of a kind which, in days to come, would be his own peculiar
      care; from end to end, the pier glowed with the placards of advertisers.
      Below, on the sands, appeared bathing-machines, and these also were
      covered with manifold advertisements. Nay, the very pleasure-boats on the
      sunny waves declared the glory of somebody&rsquo;s soap, of somebody&rsquo;s
      purgatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make that place one of the biggest advertising stations in England&mdash;see
      if I don&rsquo;t! You remember the caves? I&rsquo;m going to have them lighted with
      electricity, and painted all round with advertisements of the most
      artistic kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a brilliant idea!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something else you might like to hear of. It struck me I would
      write a Guide to Advertising, and here it is.&rsquo; He handed a copy of the
      book. &lsquo;It advertises <i>me</i>, and brings a little grist to the mill on
      its own account. Three weeks since I got it out, and we&rsquo;ve sold three
      thousand of it. Costs nothing to print; the advertisements more than pay
      for that. Price, one shilling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how you do work, Mr. Crewe! It&rsquo;s marvellous. And yet you look so
      well,&mdash;you have really a seaside colour!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never ailed much since I can remember. The harder I work, the better I
      feel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, too, have always been rather proud of my constitution.&rsquo; Her eyes
      dropped. &lsquo;But then I have led a life of idleness. Couldn&rsquo;t you make me
      useful in some way? Set me to work! I am convinced I should be so much
      happier. Let me help you, Mr. Crewe. I write a pretty fair hand, don&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe smiled at her, made a sound as if clearing his throat, grasped his
      knee, and was on the very point of momentous utterance, when the door
      opened. Turning his head impatiently, he saw, not the clerk whose duty it
      was to announce people, but a lady, much younger than Mrs. Damerel, and
      more fashionably dressed, who for some reason had preferred to announce
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you come in like that?&rsquo; Crewe demanded, staring at her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      engaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you indeed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to send in your name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They said you had a lady here, so I told them another would make no
      difference.&mdash;How do you do, Mrs. Damerel? It&rsquo;s so long since I had
      the pleasure of seeing you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice French stepped forward, smiling ominously, and eyeing first Crewe
      then his companion with curiosity of the frankest impertinence. Mrs.
      Damerel stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will speak of our business at another time, Mr. Crewe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe, red with anger, turned upon Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I am engaged&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Mrs. Damerel?&rsquo; asked the intruder airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might suppose,&rsquo;&mdash;he addressed the elder lady,&mdash;&lsquo;that this
      woman has some sort of hold upon me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope not,&rsquo; said Mrs. Damerel, &lsquo;for your own sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind. She has pestered me a good deal, and it began in
      this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice gave him so fierce a look, that his tongue faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before you tell that little story,&rsquo; she interposed, &lsquo;you had better know
      what I&rsquo;ve come about. It&rsquo;s a queer thing that Mrs. Damerel should be here;
      happens more conveniently than things generally do. I had something to
      tell you about her. You may know it, but most likely you don&rsquo;t.&mdash;You
      remember,&rsquo; she faced the other listener, &lsquo;when I came to see you a long
      time ago, I said it might be worth while to find out who you really were.
      I haven&rsquo;t given much thought to you since then, but I&rsquo;ve got hold of what
      I wanted, as I knew I should.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe did not disguise his eagerness to hear the rest. Mrs. Damerel stood
      like a statue of British respectability, deaf and blind to everything that
      conflicts with good-breeding; stony-faced, she had set her lips in the
      smile appropriate to one who is braving torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know who she is&mdash;or not?&rsquo; Beatrice asked of Crewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuffled, and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny has just told me in a letter; she got it from her husband. Our
      friend here is the mother of Horace Lord and of Nancy. She ran away from
      her first husband, and was divorced. Whether she really married
      afterwards, I don&rsquo;t quite know; most likely not. At all events, she has
      run through her money, and wants her son to set her up again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds Mrs. Damerel bore the astonished gaze of her admirer,
      then, her expression scarcely changing, she walked steadily to the door
      and vanished. The silence was prolonged till broken by Beatrice&rsquo;s laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she been bamboozling you, old man? I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.
      You had bad luck with the daughter; shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the mother would
      suit you better, all said and done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewe seated himself and gave vent to his feelings in a phrase of pure
      soliloquy: &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cut in just at the right time, did I?&mdash;No malice. I&rsquo;ve had my hit
      back at her, and that&rsquo;s enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the man of business remained absorbed in his thoughts, Beatrice took a
      chair. Presently he looked up at her, and said savagely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then take it and go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beatrice smiled, and kept her seat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nancy stood before her husband with a substantial packet in brown paper.
      It was after breakfast, at the moment of their parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is something I want you to take, and look at, and speak about the
      next time you come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho, ho! I don&rsquo;t like the look of it.&rsquo; He felt the packet. &lsquo;Several quires
      of paper here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be off, or you&rsquo;ll miss the train.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little girl! <i>Et tu</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her affectionately, and went his way. In the ordinary course of
      things Nancy would not have seen him again for ten days or a fortnight.
      She expected a letter very soon, but on the fourth evening Tarrant&rsquo;s
      fingers tapped at the window-pane. In his hand was the brown paper parcel,
      done up as when he received it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy searched his face, her own perturbed and pallid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long have you been working at this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly a year. But not every day, of course. Sometimes for a week or more
      I could get no time. You think it bad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo;&mdash;puff&mdash;&lsquo;not in any sense&rsquo;&mdash;puff&mdash;&lsquo;bad. In one
      sense, it&rsquo;s good. But&rsquo;&mdash;puff&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s a private sense; a
      domestic sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The question is, dear, can it be sold to a publisher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The question is nothing of the kind. You mustn&rsquo;t even try to sell it to a
      publisher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? You mean you would be ashamed if it came out. But I shouldn&rsquo;t
      put my own name to it. I have written it only in the hope of making money,
      and so helping you. I&rsquo;ll put any name to it you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant smoked for a minute or two, until his companion gave a sign of
      impatience. He wore a very good-humoured look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than likely you might get the thing accepted&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, then why not?&rsquo; she interrupted eagerly, with bright eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it isn&rsquo;t literature, but a little bit of Nancy&rsquo;s mind and heart,
      not to be profaned by vulgar handling. To sell it for hard cash would be
      horrible. Leave that to the poor creatures who have no choice. You are not
      obliged to go into the market.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Lionel, if it is a bit of my mind and heart, it must be a good book.
      You have often praised books to me just on that account because they were
      genuine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The books I praised were literature. Their authors came into the world to
      write. It isn&rsquo;t enough to be genuine; there must be workmanship. Here and
      there you have a page of very decent English, and you are nowhere on the
      level of the ordinary female novelist. Indeed&mdash;don&rsquo;t take it ill&mdash;I
      was surprised at what you had turned out. But&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished the sentence in smoke wreaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll try again. I&rsquo;ll do better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never <i>much</i> better. It will never be literature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does that matter? I never thought myself a Charlotte Bronte or a
      George Eliot. But so many women make money out of novels, and as I had
      spare time I didn&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t use it profitably. We want money,
      and if it isn&rsquo;t actually disgraceful&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t use my own name&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want money so badly as all that. I am writing, because I must do
      something to live by, and I know of nothing else open to me except
      pen-work. Whatever trash I turned out, I should be justified; as a man,
      it&rsquo;s my duty to join in the rough-and-tumble for more or less dirty
      ha&rsquo;pence. You, as a woman, have no such duty; nay, it&rsquo;s your positive duty
      to keep out of the beastly scrimmage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seemed to me that I was <i>doing</i> something. Why should a woman be
      shut out from the life of the world?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me that your part in the life of the world is very
      considerable. You have given the world a new inhabitant, and you are
      shaping him into a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed, and reflected, and returned to her discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, every woman can do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one woman in a thousand can bear a sound-bodied child; and not one in
      fifty thousand can bring up rightly the child she has borne. Leisure you
      must have; but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t waste it. Read, enjoy, sit down to
      the feast prepared for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted to <i>do</i> something,&rsquo; she persisted, refusing to catch his
      eye. &lsquo;I have read enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read enough? Ha, then there&rsquo;s no more to be said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His portentous solemnity overcame her. Laughter lighted her face, and
      Tarrant, laying down his pipe, shouted extravagant mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to burn it then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not. You are to seal it with seven seals, to write upon it <i>peche
      de jeunesse</i>, and to lay it away at the back of a very private drawer.
      And when you are old, you shall some day bring it out, and we&rsquo;ll put our
      shaky heads together over it, and drop a tear from our dim old eyes.&mdash;By-the-bye,
      Nancy, will you go with me to a music-hall to-morrow night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A music-hall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. It would do us both good, I think. I feel fagged, and you want a
      change.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s the end of March; please Heaven, another month shall
      see us rambling in the lanes somewhere; meantime, we&rsquo;ll go to a
      music-hall. Each season has its glory; if we can&rsquo;t hear the lark, let us
      listen to the bellow of a lion-comique.&mdash;Do you appreciate this
      invitation? It means that I enjoy your company, which is more than one man
      in ten thousand can say of his wife. The ordinary man, when he wants to
      dissipate, asks&mdash;well, not his wife. And I, in plain sober truth,
      would rather have Nancy with me than anyone else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say that to comfort me after my vexation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say it because I think it.&mdash;The day after to-morrow I want you to
      come over in the morning to see some pictures in Bond Street. And the next
      day we&rsquo;ll go to the theatre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t afford it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind your own business. I remembered this morning that I was young, and
      that I shall not be so always. Doesn&rsquo;t that ever come upon you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The manuscript, fruit of such persevering toil, was hidden away, and its
      author spoke of it no more. But she suffered a grave disappointment. Once
      or twice a temptation flashed across her mind; if she secretly found a
      publisher, and if her novel achieved moderate success (she might alter the
      title), would not Tarrant forgive her for acting against his advice? It
      was nothing more than advice; often enough he had told her that he claimed
      no coercive right; that their union, if it were to endure, must admit a
      genuine independence on both sides. But herein, as on so many other
      points, she subdued her natural impulse, and conformed to her husband&rsquo;s
      idea of wifehood. It made her smile to think how little she preserved of
      that same &lsquo;genuine independence;&rsquo; but the smile had no bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, nothing was heard of Horace. The winter passed, and June had
      come before Nancy again saw her brother&rsquo;s handwriting. It was on an
      ordinary envelope, posted, as she saw by the office-stamp, at Brighton;
      the greater her surprise to read a few lines which coldly informed her
      that Horace&rsquo;s wife no longer lived. &lsquo;She took cold one evening a fortnight
      ago, and died after three days&rsquo; illness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy tried to feel glad, but she had little hope of any benefit to her
      brother from this close of a sordid tragedy. She answered his letter, and
      begged that, as soon as he felt able to do so, he would come and see her.
      A month&rsquo;s silence on Horace&rsquo;s part had led her to conclude that he would
      not come, when, without warning, he presented himself at her door. It was
      morning, and he stayed till nightfall, but talked very little. Sitting in
      the same place hour after hour, he seemed overcome with a complete
      exhaustion, which made speech too great an effort and kept his thoughts
      straying idly. Fanny&rsquo;s name did not pass his lips; when Nancy ventured an
      inquiry concerning her, he made an impatient gesture, and spoke of
      something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      His only purpose in coming, it appeared, was to ask for information about
      the Bahamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get rid of my cough, and I&rsquo;m afraid it may turn to something
      dangerous. You said, I remember, that people with weak chests wintered in
      the Bahamas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lionel can tell you all about it. He&rsquo;ll be here to-morrow. Come and have
      a talk with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; He moved pettishly. &lsquo;Tell me as much as you know yourself. I don&rsquo;t
      feel well enough to meet people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at him with profound compassion, Nancy thought it very doubtful
      whether he would see another winter. But she told him all she could
      remember about Nassau, and encouraged him to look forward with pleasure
      and hopefulness to a voyage thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you going to live till then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he answered, with a startled and irritated look. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      not so bad as all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant&mdash;how are you going to arrange your life?&rsquo; Nancy hastened to
      explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I have comfortable lodgings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you oughtn&rsquo;t to be quite alone.&mdash;I mean it must be so
      cheerless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a proposal that he should have a room in this little house, and
      use it as a home whenever he chose; but Horace so fretted under the
      suggestion, that it had to be abandoned. His behaviour was that of an old
      man, enfeebled in mind and body. Once or twice his manner of speaking
      painfully reminded Nancy of her father during the last days of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a peevish sort of interest he watched his little nephew toddling
      about the room, but did not address a word to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab was sent for to convey him to the railway station. Nancy had known
      few such melancholy days as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning when, by agreement, she was to go into town to see her
      brother, there arrived a note from him. He had been advised to try a
      health-resort in Switzerland, and was already on the way. Sorry he could
      not let Nancy know before; would visit her on his return. Thus, in the
      style of telegraphy, as though he wrote in hot haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Switzerland came two letters, much more satisfactory in tone and
      contents. The first, written in July, announced a distinct improvement of
      health. No details being supplied, Nancy could only presume that her
      brother was living alone at the hotel from which he dated. The second
      communication, a month later, began thus: &lsquo;I think I forgot to tell you
      that I came here with Mrs. Damerel. She will stay till the end of the
      summer, and then, perhaps, go with me to the Bahamas, if that seems
      necessary. But I am getting wonderfully well and strong. Mrs. Damerel is
      kinder to me than any one in the world ever was. I shall tell you more
      about her some day.&rsquo; The writer went on to describe a project he had of
      taking a small farm in Devonshire, and living upon it as a country
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant warned his wife not to build hopes upon this surprising report,
      and a few weeks brought news that justified him. Horace wrote that he had
      suffered a very bad attack, and was only now sufficiently recovered to
      hold a pen. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we shall do, but I am in good hands. No one
      was ever better nursed, night and day&mdash;More before long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was not long. A day or two after Nancy&rsquo;s return from a seaside
      holiday, Mary brought in a telegram. It came from Mrs. Damerel. &lsquo;Your
      brother died at ten o&rsquo;clock last night, suddenly, and without pain. I am
      posting a letter he had written for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the promised letter arrived, it was found to bear a date two months
      ago. An unwonted tenderness marked the opening words.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAREST SISTER&mdash;What I am going to write is not to be sent to you
      at once. Sometimes I feel afraid that I can&rsquo;t live very long, so I have
      been making a will, and I want you to know why I have left you only half
      of what I have to leave. The other half will go to some one who has an
      equal claim on me, though you don&rsquo;t know it. She has asked me to tell you.
      If I get thoroughly well again, there will be no need of this letter, and
      I shall tell you in private something that will astonish you very much.
      But if I were to die, it will be best for you to learn in this way that
      Mrs. Damerel is much more to us than our mother&rsquo;s sister; she is our own
      mother. She told me at the time when I was behaving like an idiot at
      Bournemouth. It ought to have been enough to stop me. She confessed that
      she had done wrong when you and I were little children; that was how she
      came to marry again whilst father was still alive. Though it seemed
      impossible, I have come to love her for her great kindness to me. I know
      that I could trust you, dearest Nancy, to let her share whatever you have;
      but it will be better if I provide for her in my will. She has been living
      on a small capital, and now has little left. What I can give her is little
      enough, but it will save her from the worst extremities. And I beg you,
      dear sister, to forgive her fault, if only for my sake, because she has
      been so loving to a silly and useless fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may as well let you know about my wife&rsquo;s death. She was consumptive, but
      seemed to get much better at Bournemouth; then she wanted to go to
      Brighton. We lived there at a boardinghouse, and she behaved badly, very
      badly. She made acquaintances I didn&rsquo;t like, and went about with them in
      spite of my objections. Like an obstinate fool, I had refused to believe
      what people told me about her, and now I found it all out for myself. Of
      course she only married me because I had money. One evening she made up
      her mind to go with some of her friends in a boat, by moonlight. We
      quarrelled about it, but she went all the same. The result was that she
      got inflammation of the lungs, and died. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be sorry for
      her, and I am thankful to have been released from misery so much sooner
      than I deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let me tell you how my affairs stand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first reading, Nancy gave but slight attention to this concluding
      paragraph. Even the thought of her brother&rsquo;s death was put aside by the
      emotions with which she learnt that her mother still lived. After brooding
      over the intelligence for half a day, she resolved to question Mary, who
      perhaps, during so long a residence in Grove Lane, had learnt something of
      the trouble that darkened her master&rsquo;s life. The conversation led to a
      disclosure by Mary of all that had been confided to her by Mr. Lord; the
      time had come for a fulfilment of her promise to the dead man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Horace&rsquo;s letter Nancy sent by post to her husband, requesting him to let
      her know his thoughts about it in writing before they again met. Of her
      own feeling she gave no sign. &lsquo;I want you to speak of it just as if it
      concerned a stranger, plainly and simply. All I need say is, that I never
      even suspected the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant did not keep her long in suspense, and his answer complied in
      reasonable measure with the desire she had expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The disclosure has, of course, pained you. Equally, of course, you wish
      it were not necessary to let me know of it; you are in doubt as to how it
      will affect me; you perhaps fear that I shall&mdash;never mind about
      phrasing. First, then, a word on that point. Be assured once for all that
      nothing external to yourself can ever touch the feeling which I now have
      for you. &ldquo;One word is too often profaned;&rdquo; I will say simply that I hold
      you in higher regard that any other human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try not to grieve, my dearest. It is an old story, in both senses. You
      wish to know how I view the matter. Well, if a wife cannot love her
      husband, it is better she should not pretend to do so; if she love some
      one else, her marriage is at an end, and she must go. Simple enough&mdash;provided
      there be no children. Whether it is ever permissible for a mother to
      desert her children, I don&rsquo;t know. I will only say that, in you yourself,
      I can find nothing more admirable than the perfect love which you devote
      to your child. Forsake it, you could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In short, act as feeling dictates. Your mother lives; that fact cannot be
      ignored. In your attitude towards her, do not consult me at all; whatever
      your heart approves, I shall find good and right. Only, don&rsquo;t imagine that
      your feeling of to-day is final&mdash;I would say, make no resolve; they
      are worth little, in any concern of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Write to me again, and say when you wish to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading this, Nancy moved about with the radiance of a great joy on
      her countenance. She made no haste to reply; she let a day elapse; then,
      in the silence of a late hour, took pen and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do I wish to see you? Always; in every moment of my day. And yet I
      have so far conquered &ldquo;the unreasonable female&rdquo;&mdash;do you remember
      saying that?&mdash;that I would rather never see you again than bring you
      to my side except when it was your pleasure to be with me. Come as soon as
      you can&mdash;as soon as you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My mother&mdash;how shall I word it? She is nothing to me. I don&rsquo;t feel
      that Nature bids me love her. I could pardon her for leaving my father;
      like you, I see nothing terrible in that; but, like you, I <i>know</i>
      that she did wrong in abandoning her little children, and her kindness to
      Horace at the end cannot atone for it. I don&rsquo;t think she has any love for
      <i>me</i>. We shall not see each other; at all events, that is how I feel
      about it at present. But I am very glad that Horace made provision for her&mdash;that
      of course was right; if he had not done it, it would have been my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had better tell you that Mary has known my mother&rsquo;s story for a long
      time&mdash;but not that she still lived. My father told her just before
      his death, and exacted her promise that, if it seemed well, she would
      repeat everything to me. You shall know more about it, though it is bad
      all through. My dear father had reason bitterly to regret his marriage
      long before she openly broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But come and see me, and tell me what is to be done now that we are free
      to look round. There is no shame in taking what poor Horace has given us.
      You see that there will be at least three thousand pounds for our share,
      apart from the income we shall have from the business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sure to come on the evening of the morrow. Nancy went out before
      breakfast to post her letter; light-hearted in the assurance that her
      husband&rsquo;s days of struggle were over, that her child&rsquo;s future no longer
      depended upon the bare hope that its father would live and thrive by a
      profession so precarious as that of literature, she gave little thought to
      the details of the new phase of life before her. Whatever Tarrant proposed
      would be good in her sight. Probably he would wish to live in the country;
      he might discover the picturesque old house of which he had so often
      spoken. In any case, they would now live together. He had submitted her to
      a probation, and his last letter declared that he was satisfied with the
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway in the morning, whilst she was playing with her little boy,&mdash;rain
      kept them in the house,&mdash;a knock at the front door announced some
      unfamiliar visit. Mary came to the parlour, with a face of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss. Morgan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Jessica?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary handed an envelope, addressed to &lsquo;Mrs. Tarrant.&rsquo; It contained a sheet
      of paper, on which was written in pencil: &lsquo;I beg you to see me, if only
      for a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will see her,&rsquo; said Nancy, when she had frowned in brief
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary led away the little boy, and, a moment after, introduced Jessica
      Morgan. At the appearance of her former friend, Nancy with difficulty
      checked an exclamation; Miss. Morgan wore the garb of the Salvation Army.
      Harmonious therewith were the features shadowed by the hideous bonnet: a
      face hardly to be recognised, bloodless, all but fleshless, the eyes set
      in a stare of weak-minded fanaticism. She came hurriedly forward, and
      spoke in a quick whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was afraid you would refuse to see me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why have you come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was impelled&mdash;I had a duty to perform.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Coldly, Nancy invited her to sit down, but the visitor shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t take a seat in your house. I am unwelcome; we can&rsquo;t pretend to
      be on terms of friendliness. I have come, first of all,&rsquo;&mdash;her eyes
      wandered as she spoke, inspecting the room,&mdash;&lsquo;to humble myself before
      you&mdash;to confess that I was a dishonourable friend,&mdash;to make
      known with my lips that I betrayed your secret&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy interrupted the low, hurrying, panting voice, which distressed her
      ear as much as the facial expression that accompanied it did her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need to tell me. I knew it at the time, and you did me no
      harm. Indeed, it was a kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew away, but Jessica moved after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I supposed you knew. But it is laid upon me to make a confession before
      you. I have to ask your pardon, most humbly and truly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that some one has told you to do this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; A gleam of infinite conceit shot over the humility of Jessica&rsquo;s
      countenance. &lsquo;I am answerable only to my own soul. In the pursuit of an
      ideal which I fear you cannot understand, I subdue my pride, and confess
      how basely I behaved to you. Will you grant me your forgiveness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her gloveless hands before her breast, and the fingers writhed
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it is any satisfaction to you,&rsquo; replied Nancy, overcome with wonder
      and pity, &lsquo;I will say those words. But don&rsquo;t think that I take upon myself&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only say them. I ask your pardon&mdash;say you grant it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy uttered the formula, and with bowed head Jessica stood for a minute
      in silence; her lips moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; she said at length, &lsquo;I must fulfil the second part of the duty
      which has brought me here.&rsquo; Her attitude changed to one of authority, and
      her eyes fixed themselves on Nancy&rsquo;s, regarding her with the mild but
      severe rebuke of a spiritual superior. &lsquo;Having acknowledged my
      wrong-doing, I must remind you of your own. Let me ask you first of all&mdash;have
      you any religious life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s eyes had turned away, but at these words they flashed sternly upon
      the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall let you ask no such question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expected it,&rsquo; Jessica sighed patiently. &lsquo;You are still in the darkness,
      out of which <i>I</i> have been saved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have nothing more to say than this, I must refuse to talk any
      longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a word I must speak,&rsquo; pursued Jessica. &lsquo;If you will not heed it
      now, it will remain in your memory, and bear fruit at the appointed time.
      I alone know of the sin which poisons your soul, and the experiences
      through which I have passed justify me in calling you to repentance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop! That is quite enough. Perhaps you are behaving conscientiously; I
      will try to believe it. But not another word, or I shall speak as I don&rsquo;t
      wish to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is enough. You know very well what I refer to. Don&rsquo;t imagine that
      because you are now a married woman&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy stepped to the door, and threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave the house,&rsquo; she said, in an unsteady tone. &lsquo;You said you were
      unwelcome, and it was true. Take yourself out of my sight!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica put her head back, murmured some inaudible words, and with a smile
      of rancorous compassion went forth into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      On recovering from the excitement of this scene, Nancy regretted her
      severity; the poor girl in the hideous bonnet had fallen very low, and her
      state of mind called for forbearance. The treachery for which Jessica
      sought pardon was easy to forgive; not so, however, the impertinent
      rebuke, which struck at a weak place in Nancy&rsquo;s conscience. Just when the
      course of time and favour of circumstances seemed to have completely
      healed that old wound, Jessica, with her crazy malice grotesquely
      disguised, came to revive the half-forgotten pangs, the shame and the
      doubt that had seemed to be things gone by. It would have become her,
      Nancy felt, to treat her hapless friend of years ago in a spirit of gentle
      tolerance; that she could not do so proved her&mdash;and she recognised
      the fact&mdash;still immature, still a backward pupil in the school of
      life.&mdash;&lsquo;And in the Jubilee year I thought myself a decidedly
      accomplished person!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind. Her husband would come this evening. Of him she could learn
      without humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arrival was later than of wont. Only at eleven o&rsquo;clock, when with
      disappointment she had laid aside her book to go to bed, did Tarrant&rsquo;s rap
      sound on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had given you up,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you are quite good-tempered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the pleasant custom of wives to make a husband uncomfortable if he
      comes late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I am no true wife!&rsquo; laughed Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something much better,&rsquo; Tarrant muttered, as he threw off his overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to talk of ordinary affairs, and nearly half-an-hour elapsed
      before any mention was made of the event that had bettered their
      prospects. Nancy looked over a piece of his writing in an evening paper
      which he had brought; but she could not read it with attention. The paper
      fell to her lap, and she sat silent. Clearly, Tarrant would not be the
      first to speak of what was in both their minds. The clock ticked; the rain
      pattered without; the journalist smoked his pipe and looked thoughtfully
      at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sorry,&rsquo; Nancy asked, &lsquo;that I am no longer penniless?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah&mdash;to be sure. We must speak of that. No, I&rsquo;m not sorry. If I get
      run over, you and the boy&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can make ourselves comfortable, and forget you; to be sure. But for the
      present, and until you do get run over?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish to make changes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one or two respects, perhaps. But leave me out of the question. You
      have an income of your own to dispose of; nothing oppressively splendid, I
      suppose. What do you think of doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you advise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. Make your own suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy smiled, hesitated, and said at length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we ought to take a house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In London?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as you wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. As <i>you</i> wish. Do you want society?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In moderation. And first of all, yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarrant met her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of my society, you have quite as much as is good for you,&rsquo; he answered
      amiably. &lsquo;That you should wish for acquaintances, is reasonable enough.
      Take a house somewhere in the western suburbs. One or two men I know have
      decent wives, and you shall meet them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you? You won&rsquo;t live with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know my view of that matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy kept her eyes down, and reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will it be known to everybody that we don&rsquo;t live together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; answered Tarrant, with a laugh, &lsquo;by way of example, I should
      rather like it to be known; but as I know <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t like it, let
      the appearances be as ordinary as you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Nancy reflected. She had a struggle with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just one question,&rsquo; she said at length. &lsquo;Look me in the face. Are you&mdash;ever
      so little&mdash;ashamed of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her steadily, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the least.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were&mdash;you used to be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before I knew you; and before I knew myself. When, in fact, <i>you</i>
      were a notable young lady of Camberwell, and <i>I</i>&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to puff at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A notable young fool of nowhere at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
